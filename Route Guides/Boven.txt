INTRODUCTION

Welcome to ‘Boven! If you are reading this, there is a good chance you
are at Africa’s best sport climbing destination! Or at the very least, you
are considering making a trip here. Read on.

Waterval Boven (meaning ‘above the waterfall’ in Dutch) has over 600
sport  climbs  ranging  from  grade  8  to  34  (French  grade  4  to  8c),  and
plenty  of  excellent  trad  climbing.  The  rock  here  is  proper!  It’s  a
stubborn  2.3  billion  year  old,  bullet-hard  quartzite!  It  has  a  real  time-
earned quality about it.

The  climbs  are  typically  vertical  to  gently  overhanging  with  the  odd
overlap and if you are (un)lucky a roof. Endurance with technical cruxy
moves  thrown  in  here  and  there  is  the  predominant  style;  precise
footwork and finger strength are an advantage!

The  crags  give  views  over  remote  wooded  valleys  and  hills  full  of
animal  and  plant-life;  the  bases  of  the  climbs  are  flat  and  shady,  the
crags  are  quiet  and  the  walk-ins  are  a  breeze.  It  is  one  of  the  few
climbing areas in the world where weather is good for climbing almost
all year round. The Wonderland Crags are an obvious place to start, but
not to climb at the Waterfall and Restaurant Crags would be a pity.

Rest-day  activities  include  game  viewing  in  the  world  famous  Kruger
National Park, hiking, trout-fishing, mountain-biking..or just basking in
the sun. Enjoy our friendly people, the African vibe and our wonderful
orange rock!

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

A big thumbs up to those at the core of the Boven scene, for making it
what it is! Special mentions include Gustav Janse van Rensburg for
providing much help with descripions and for his amazing photos and
the panoramic ‘topo’ shots. Gus and Alex are the ‘guardians’ of Boven
so shower them gratitude, praise and kisses on the cheeks! Huge respect
to  the  Mountain  Club  of  South  Africa  for  allowing  access  to  their
crags at Boven and for their ongoing support for bolting new climbs and

re-bolting old ones. And of course, Mike and Ruth Behr for making
Tranquilitas what it is and for allowing free access to their crags. And to
Reuben  and  Camilla  Kruger,  the  owners  of  the  ‘Mayhem  Crags’.
Thanks  to  those  who  have  provided  photographs  to  make  this  guide
prettier.  Of  course  much  thanks  to those  who  develop  new  lines,  give
yourselves a pat on the back! Finally, thanks to ClimbZA for hosting
the guide on their super website.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW AND
STUFF YOU DON’T

When to Visit

Almost any time of year you can experience great conditions, something that is hard to
find at climbing destinations elsewhere in the world.

South  Africa  is  in  the  southern hemisphere…we  have  summer  while  Europe  or  North
America is in winter and vice-versa! A big difference to remember though, the African
winter  is  dry  and  the  summer  is  wet  (unless  you  are  in  the  Cape  where  it  rains
unrelentingly in the winter!).

During winter (also known as the ‘dry season’ – April to October) many weeks can go
by without a drop of rain - perfect for climbing but it can get chilly (averaging to 8 to
20+  degrees during the day and sub zero to 5 degrees at night); a down–jacket is needed
for belaying in the shade and the place can get a little dry and dusty. Winter also happens
to be ‘The Season’ for Rocklands so the two destinations could be combined if you don’t
mind the 18 hour drive from the Cape.

It’s rarely too hot to climb in Boven as it is high up, nearly 1800 metres above sea-level
and most crags are shady by midday (east and south east facing). Hot summer days are
rarely more than 30 degrees and it can be as cool as 15 degrees, especially after a rain
storm.

Bring a down jacket, whatever time of year it is. If it’s mid-summer (late November to
early February), bring a raincoat as Boven experiences huge amounts of rain at this time,
in the form of afternoon thundershowers every day or two. However, after rain, the rock
dries very quickly and climbing is possible most days and the scenery transforms into a
lush paradise.

Where to Stay

There are various options, from camping, climbers lodge, , self-catering
cottages, guesthouses, b&b’s. It depends on what your budget is and needs are, and how
close to the climbing you want to be. Roc ‘n Rope are best placed to advise. To name
just a couple of the options:



8


The Roc ‘n Rope climbers’ lodge (see advert page 8) in Waterval Boven. Stop in
at the Office/home of Gus and Alex at the end of the main street in Waterval Boven. The
lodge is a block from here and is the original climbers hang-out. It has a fully euipped
large kitchen, balcony/braai area and comfy lounge. You can walk to the Waterfall crags
from  here.  Good  value  dorm  beds  and  inexpensive  small  double  rooms  are  available.
There are normally a handful of road-tripping foreigners around and the odd local. Roc
n’ Rope Adventures (www.rocrope.com) (+27 (0) 13 257 0363) know the area inside out
and  are  extremely  helpful  (Gustav  wrote  the  2004  Guidebook  so  he  knows  his  way
around the crags!).

Or, if you want to stay up in the hills, 5 minutes walk from the Wonderland Crags you
can stay at Tranquilitas Adventure Farm (see advert on page 11) which is in an
amazing position overlooking the valley. (www.tranquilitas.com). +27 82 3880100 (See
advert page 11). Some of the best crags at Boven are not more than a 5 to 10 minutes
walk; there is a swimming pool and great fire sites. Mornings are spent drinking coffee
and  relaxing  on  the  lawns  until  11-ish  (when  the  crags  go  into  shade)  and  climbers
gather around camp-fires during the evenings. If you book in advance you can stay in
one of the small but well equipped chalets or safari-tents. There is also a luxury farm
house that can accommodate a large group, and a kiosk, where you can get snacks and
excellent coffee. At the time of writing, MCSA members get a discount on camping.

Troutways Retreat (see advert on page 12) has self catering options for small to
large groups in ‘lodges’. Ideal for families with children as there are farm animals
(always a winner!) damns with trout, a jungle gym, a pool and huge lawns to play on. It
is located in a very quiet location off the road between town and The Wonderland so is
central to all the crags. Either book direct www.troutways.co.za or call Hein on 082 777
2892, or book through Roc ‘n Rope.

How to get to Boven – (see map on page 10)


Best is by car but see bus info below.

From Johannesburg airport (O R Tambo International):  tricky
getting out from the maze of options at the airport…full concentration needed! Take the
R21 south (to Boksburg) for a few kilometers then the N12 east towards eMalahleni
(Witbank), which becomes the N4. These are excellent highways and within 2.5 hours,
the turn-off to  Waterval Boven is reached  on  the  right,  several  kilometers  after  the
second  toll  gate  (peage).  Note:  8  kms  before  Boven,  the  highway  splits  into  two  just
after the second toll gate (peage). Both are still signed N4 Nelspruit (!?), but only one of
them passes Boven! Keep straight, don’t take the left fork, many first time visitors make
the mistake of going left which leads in completely the wrong direction! Tolls (Péage)
are paid in cash or with a South African visa card. At the time of writing they are
R50 and R75.




9

If you are first time visitor or going to Waterval Boven town, you should
stick to the N4 all the way and pay the toll just before Boven . It’s also less
wear on your car..

o

o



If  you  are  going  to  Tranquilitas  but  not  to  town,  its  worth  considering
skipping the expensive toll gate just before Boven and going in the ‘back
way’. Not adviseable if dark/wet/first time/you have a low/expensive car.


To do the toll skip: Turn off  the highway (right) at Machadodorp, approximately 15
kilometres before Boven (see map on page 11): Drive into Machadodorp then take the
tar road towards Badplaas (signed) for approx 13 kms, then turn left towards ‘Nkmomati
Mine’. After 3.2 kms turn left onto a gravel road signed Waterval Boven. Keep on this,
keeping left at the fork at 6.5 kms, the road leads past the Tranquilitas Adventure farm
and  the  Wonderland  crags.  Even  when  in  bad  condition,  so  long  as  its  dry  its  always
passable even in a small car but if its been raining it’s 4x4s only.



If  you  don’t  have  a  car  Lowveld  Link  leave/return  to  Joburg  once  a  day
(www.lowveldlink.com)  but they  only  drop  at the  Boven  turn off  from  the  N4  but  its
only 1-2 kms walk from there to Roc ‘n Rope. Expect to pay between R 300 and 400
return. Alternatively, post a note on the climb.co.za forum and there is a good chance
you will find a ride, and some new friends!






10

o  The Boven government hospital can help with many an ailment though you

may want to consider travelling to the private hospital  in Middelburg
(MidMed) or Nelspruit (Medi Clinic) for something serious. The Boven
hospital is 1 km out of town, up the road from Roc ‘n Rop.
For life threatening situations be sure to call Mountain Rescue 074 125 1385 /
074 163 3952 and let Roc ‘n Rope know. 082 753 3695/013 2570363

Groceries, money and other stuff
Support the local economy!! - get as much as you can in Boven. Certainly; fuel,
firewood,alchohol, basic groceries, meat.

The TARS Multisave supermarket sells basics like fresh milk, cheddar cheese, pasta,
cereal, sliced bread, rusks etc but not much else other than tinned stuff. The two butchers
(slaghuis) in town sell excellent fresh meat and at 2/3 the price you pay in Jo’burg. The
greengrocer  next  to  the  butcher  on  the  north  side  of  the  railway  tracks  sells  carrots,
potatoes, gem squash, cabbage and a few bananas and apples, all very cheap.

If you want fancier food you will need to bring some with you, either from the city, or
you can stop at the huge Highveld Mall which has everything (Woolworths, Pick n Pay
etc)  and  is  located  conveniently  right  by  the  highway,  just  before  the  Middleburg  toll
gate (located about halfway to Boven from Jo’burg or Pretoria). Take the President
Laan  Offramp.  There  is  even  a  huge  Outdoor  Warehouse  which  sells  everything  you
might need for camping.

There is no pharmacy in town but TARS sells basics.

There is a First National Bank ATM (cash machine) in Boven which will accept all visa
cards. It’s on the main street, you can’t miss it.

If you are in Boven and need a major stock-up with food, Nelspruit is the nearest big
town and has all the large supermarkets you could desire. To get there, go back to the
highway and turn right, drive for 1 hour, watch for speed cameras on final 20 kms.. Start
at the Riverside Mall.


Eating Out
Various options from a burger to a sit down meal in style, best get advise from Roc ‘n
Rope. To mentin a couple of places in town where decent simple dishes are available:


Steam  Inn  (013  2571008)  is  on  the  main  street  and  serves  high  calorie  but
quality  burgers  and  grills.  The  Shamrock  Arms  stopped  serving  meals  a
while back, unless you are staying there.

For easily the best eating experience within a 50 km radius, get back o the
N4 highway and drive down the Elands Valley, 5km out of town will take you
to Aloes Country Pub for truly great meals, awesome fresh trout (this is trout
country!)  and  pizza.  Definitely  worth  the  drive.  Again  check  with  Roc  ‘n
Rope.

13

For  a  one  hundred-percent  genuine  South  African  experience  ‘chicken  dust’
(barbequed  chicken)  served  with  pap  (maize  meal)
township
(Emgwenya)  is  a  must,  but  its  best  to  check  with  Roc  ‘n  Rop  to  see  if  and
when. It’s not a given that it’s cooking.

Climbing Guiding
If you are a ‘newbie’ and want to learn how to climb or abseil or just have a fund day out
doing so, as an individual or as a group Roc ‘n Rope are fully kitted out and qualified.
You  are  in  the  best  hands  you  can  be.  They  also  run  climbing  training  from  early  to
advanced stages, for the relevent industry-acreditation.

Climbing Gear Locally
Roc ‘n Rope has a  well stocked climbing shop which sells everything  from chalk to
ropes. If you forgot some kit or need stuff for beginner friends, Roc 'n Rope also rents
full sets of climbing gear and shoes.




Gus and Alex at Roc n Rope can sort you out with just about anything. Tel 013 257 0363

Dangers and annoyances!!
Most  dangerous  of  all:  Local  climbers  can  be  a  source  of  dodgy  beta  and
sandbagging. Take anything they say with a pinch of chalk.



•  There is no malaria in Boven so malarial pills would be a waste of money
unless you enjoy (scary) trippy dreams. If a trip to the Kruger Park is planned,
malaria pills might be advisable. The mosquitoes can be annoying though, any
time of year; repellant works well.



14



•  Ticks are common during spring and summer. If you do get bitten, the wound
might become very itchy and red and may lead to quite a serious (but not life
threatening) fever (splitting headache, swollen glands, aching limbs) known as
‘Tick-bite fever’. You should seek medical attention; normally antibiotics are
required. Ticks are normally the large (2-3 mm) brown variety and are pretty
easy to spot; check your legs after walking in the long grass.

•

There are several varieties of poisonous snake common in the area, but you
are  very  unlikely  to  encounter  one  so  don’t  worry  about  them,  they  are  far
more worried about you. We are aware of only one climber-snake-bite incident
in Boven over the last 20 years. In the very unlikely event that you are bitten,
try not to move the affected limb, keep it elevated, wrap a bandage over the
whole  limb  (not  too  much  pressure)  and  get  to  the  hospital  quickly.  Try
remember what the snake looked like but don’t try catch it, it will bite again!

•



This is not a dangerous creature..unless it eats your rope.


Spiders…lots  but  nearly  all  harmless.  You  will  see  plenty  of  the  funny  flat
ones on the rocks and walls (wall spiders) and the pretty ones that make webs
across the paths but they are harmless. There are one or two poisonous spiders
but they are rarely seen, they normally hide away in holes or under things. Lift
a few rocks and you might see a few scorpions but hardly ever has a climber
been bitten and bites are almost never lethal for an adult.


•  Wasps  like  to  make  little  hanging  nests  (normally  1-5  wasps)  on  the  cliffs,
normally only visible when you are within 2-3 metres. Don’t pannick, they are
15





pretty chilled and very dumb! Either climb to the side, or quickly swipe off the
nest  (using  your  finger,  a  chalk-bag  or  a  stick  depending  on  the  size  of  the
nest, and your bravery!); the wasps then move away after a minute or two and
don’t  return.  If  it’s  a  next  with  more  than  a  few  wasps,  it  might  be  worth
lowering off and getting a can of ‘doom’. If you do get stung, it is sore but not
serious unless you have an allergy. There are one or two bee nests at Boven,
when the bees are buzzing, keep well clear! There has been one for years at to
the right of Tripolactic Fairytales at the Superbowl.

There have been one or two muggings over the years, but infrequently. When
walking around town, be discreet with your wealth, the people in Boven are
mostly  poor  so  please  respect  that.  There  is  a  risk  of  an  unwelcome
encounter at the crags of Sport Valley (Pasture, Coven, Other Side, Flying is
Fun)  as  these  are  close  to  the  township.  An  incident  is  unlikely  but  as  a
precaution  do  not  take  valuables  to  these  crags  and  rather  go  in  a  large
group. If you do experience an incident, report it to the police as soon as you
can.

•

•  Tap-water  in  Boven  is  safe  to  drink  though  it  can  taste  quite  chlorinated
sometimes.  Fill  up  at  the  tap  at  the  Tranquilitas  farmhouse  or  campsite,  it’s
from a borehole and is delicious.

•

There  are  no  dangerous  animals!  Lions  and  elephants  and  other  fearsome
beasts were wiped out long ago. If you want to see the scary beasts, head to the
Kruger Park. You will hear baboons barking from the forests below, but they
are wild and do not approach people (unlike the baboons in the Cape, which
will swipe handbags and rifle through backpacks!). If they do get close, ignore
them, don’t stare or try to intimidate them and if you have a dog, keep it on a
leash. NEVER feed any wild animals.

•  During  the  summer,  lightening  storms  can  be  massive.  Being  caught  out
exposed  in  a  storm  is  very  serious;  a  climber  was  tragically  killed  by
lightening in 2011. You normally get 15 to 20 minutes advance warning..dark
towering clouds, wind and maybe rumbles of distant thunder. If it looks like it
might be big one, run for cover but only if you are sure that you have enough
time, otherwise stay at the crag and take shelter under as big an overhang as
possible.  If  the  lightening  gets  close,  move  away  from  quickdraws  and  wet
ropes, kneel on your pack, keep a couple of metres away from the cliff, never
at the back of a cave unless it’s very deep. Storms can take anything from 20
minutes to an hour to move off. Never climb or walk out during a storm, your
gear and the wet rope and rock is very conductive.

16











•  The sun is intense in Africa; it can burn even through thick cloud. If you are
walking around or climbing in the sun wear sun screen and cover up, even on a
cloudy day,

Rest Days

Two  hours  east  of  Boven,  towards  Mozambique  you  can  enjoy  the  ultimate  resting
activity… game-viewing, the only pastime that consumes fewer calories than watching
TV! The Kruger National Park is South Africa’s biggest and one of the greatest in the
world. All of the big tusked and toothed animals reside there in abundance. You don’t
have to spend big bucks, you can camp or stay in moderately priced chalets. Check out
www.sanparks.co.za . It’s important to book ahead; unless it’s a weekday and not during
holidays,  the  park  can  be  very  busy.  At  quiet  times  you  can  normally  get  away  with
booking a couple of days in advance.

If you want to burn a few calories on your rest day, the mountain-biking is incredible;
the bikers rave about miles and miles of single track (whatever that is). The kayaking,
horse-riding and fly-fishing are also reported to be wonderful; ask at Roc ‘n Rope.

If you feel like a hair cut, ‘cruising’ malls, going to the cinema, sitting in coffee shops
etc..go to Nelspruit, the nearest large town/city to Boven. It’s an easy 1 hour drive east
on the N4. The Riverside Mall is reputed to have it all!

Swimming! On a hot summer day when the streams are full, there is an amazing
secluded pool with shady flat rocks to pic-nic on, in the river by the Gym (see page 83)

Where to climb…on a rainy day?
If its just light rain, you will find that most of the climbs that are vertical or more stay
dry, walk down to the crags and you will be amazed. If it’s properly hammering down,
there are a few lines at Baboon Butress and the God No! Wall that stay dry even in t he
heaviest downpour.

Where to climb…on a super cold day?
The  lower  elevation  the  warmer  the  crag…  shady  crags  of  the  Wonderland  are  the
coldest as they are highest, you may freeze your chalk-balls off. The Restaurant or The
Last  Crag  are  typically  a  couple  degrees  warmer.  If  you  want  some  winter  sun,
Tranquilitas is perfect. The Foundry can be too hot, even on a really cold day as the sun
blasts directly at the rock and there is no shade at the base.

Where to climb…on sweltering hot day?
Rest until 2-3 pm. Then try any of the Wonderland Crags or The Mayhem that are in
shade. Crags that go into shade early are best, firsr is Mayhem then God No!, Baboon
Butress  or  the  Right  Wing.  The  chasms  of  Never-neverland  down  at  the  Isalnd  are
always cool, breezy…and spooky! Or go to the Gym and swim in the perfect deep cool
pool by the crag.

Climbing Safety


•  Boven  rock  is  remarkably  hard  (try  drill  it!)  but  blocks  small  and  large
sometimes come loose and have caused death. Climbers and belayers should
wear helmets. If you are watching don’t sit/stand below the climber and if you
are belaying stay away from the ‘fall zone’ if you can, certainly if the climber
is on a potentially loose section.


•  Always  double  check  your  harness  and  knots  and  your  belayer!  And  check

your partners knots when it’s his/her time to climb.




•  Walking along the top and reaching down to chains is dangerous; this is when
accidents happen! If you are trying to retrieve gear or place draws from the top
be very careful or reconsider. Set-up an abeil anchor back from the cliff.

•  Bolts in Boven are typically in good condition. However, keep an eye out for
loose  hangars  or  chains  etc.  If  you  do  spot  something  dodgy,  let  one  of  the
active local climbers know about it.


•  Never trust your life to a single bolt. If you are unable to reach the chains and
need to clean the climb, sacrifice two ‘bail biners’ and thread the rope through
a  bail  biner  clipped  to  the  previous  bolt  as  a  back-up  to  the  one  you  are
lowering off.


•  Watch  out  for  others…there  are  some  idiots  out  there!  if  they  are  in  a
dangerous position tell them. Check their knots before they start climbing. Tell
other  climbers  if  they  are  doing  something  that  is  risky,  they  may  be
inexperienced.


What gear?

The usual climbers kit plus..


15-16 draws will get you up and down almost everything.

•
•  A 70-metre rope will get you down from almost all of the climbs; a 60 will be
enough for 95 percent of the climbs. Always tie a knot in the other end of the
rope if it looks like a longish climb.

•  Bring  a  down-jacket,  whatever  time  of  year  it  is.  It  can  be  chilly  even  in
midsummer! A rain-coat can be handy, especially during summer, but is not
essential.
Finger-tape can be handy if you are going to try some of the harder/crimpier
lines. The rock is very easy on the skin, but a small hold is a small hold…!

•

The crags are NOT yours!!



18


We should be very grateful to the landowners (private and municipal)
who allow us access to their wonderful crags.



The  crags  are  not  yours  and  must  be  treated  with
respect;  not  doing  so  could  easily  result  in  the
closure of the crags. Please do your bit and stick to
the following rules:


READ THESE RULES AND REMIND OTHERS OF THEM.



1.  Climb safely. If you are not sufficiently experienced, get some

training or a guide.


2.  Do not drop any litter, however small, including cigarette
butts,  finger  tape  and  tissue  paper!  Take  all  this  rubbish
home with you. If you find rubbish, please pick it up, you are
helping us all.


3.  If  you  must  take  a  crap  at  the  crag,  go  at  least  30
metres down-hill and away from the cliff in the bushes and
make  sure  you  dig  a  hole  and  cover  it  with  dirt  and  leaves
afterwards. Never do your business in a cave or corner. Do not
leave toilet paper lying around; buy it or carry it out.



4.  If you take a pee, do not do it close to the cliff, make
sure it’s in a place that is not sheltered from rain, otherwise it
stinks.

dogs are a nuisance and are not welcome, they sniff at
food, walk over ropes, get in the way and frighten people.


7.  Respect  others;  try  not  to  be  too  loud  and  think  carefully
about  smoking,  bringing  your  dogs  or  crying  children  to  the
crags; these things can spoil the pleasure for others.

the first bolt means the route is ‘In Progress’ and the route is
a closed project. Do not try theses climbs unless you have
permission from the ‘’owner’’.

they have been hanging there for weeks. Some locals like to
leave projects clipped-up. You may of course climb the routes
using the draws left up.

WTF!!

Trad climbs are indicated by an ‘old style’ font and by the abbreviation ‘Trad’.

‘MCSA  bolts’  indicates  that  the  Johannesburg  and  Magaliesberg  sections  of  the
Mountain Club of South Africa sponsored the bolts, for specified new climbs and for re-
bolted old climbs. Big thanks to the MCSA for this support.

Finding the Climbs

Topo drawings do not feature in this book, they eat megabytes and are not needed, most
of the climbs are easy to find once you are at the crag. Names of the routes are often
written on the rock in black marker pen or scratched at the base of the climb. Maybe
the  names  are  only  written  on  a  couple  of  the  routes,  find  these  as  a  reference  to  the
others If you are struggling to find a climb, ask a local if there is one around..

Sectors  are  described  approximately  from  left  to  right  (south  to  north)  along  the
escarpment; from Wonderland to Triple Tier then The Restaurant Crags, Sport Valley,
then  the  Waterfall  Crags.  At  each  crag,  climbs  are  described  from  left  to  right  when
facing the rock.

South African Grades

Just remember 30 is 8a! Not quite the same as the Australian system which is one grade
out! The grades in SA, in particular Boven are considered solid, no ‘holiday’ grades like
at Kalymnos or Thailand.




18 = 6a

24 = 7a

30 = 8a




Updates and Opening New Routes
If you want to open a new route and are not experienced at bolting, please don’t be shy,
ask for guidance, and obey the following rules.


•  Be sure it’s not an existing trad climb (this has been done before!) or a
closed project (normally IP written on the on rock or some tape at the first
bolt)
If your climb branches off or runs close to an existing climb, you must check
with the ascentionist of that climb, you may be detracting from it.

•

•  Only bolt worthwhile routes..1 and 2-star climbs just detract from the overall

quality of the climbing at Boven. Just because it’s a gap, it doesn’t need
filling..!

•  Avoid adding bolts just to create new ‘link-ups’. Unless there is a

significant amount of new climbing added, it just detracts from the purity
of the existing lines.

•  Clean off loose rock, including big blocks if present. Use a hammer and crow-

bar..make your climb safe.

•  Only use stainless steel expansion bolts, 10 mm diameter, 68-70 mm long.
These will likely last for 30 years and more. Use purpose-made lower-offs or
thick chains, not just a pair of old biners as these kink the rope badly.

22



•  Don’t rush, place bolts in the optimal positions. If you do make a mistake,
move the bolt and hammer off the poorly placed bolt then conceal the scar
with putty. Placing bolts poorly and leaving bolts sticking out is lousy and
lazy,  it reflects badly on the equipper.

•  Be sure to post updates and new route info on the Climb ZA Routes Wiki :

http://www.climb.co.za/wiki/index.php/Waterval_Boven

•  Clear the smaller bushes and branches at the base so that the belayer has a clear view of

the climber.

THE MAYHEM CRAGS

See map on page 26

Developed since start of 2015. Actually where the greatest tranquility is found, these
crags are on the next farm south of Tranquiltas, accessed by a 15 minute easy walk from
the Tranquilitas Campsite. Grades range from 16 to 29. Climbing is on compact
technical walls and arête climbing on amazing quality rock above a valley that is deep
and unspoilt. The setting has a ‘wilder’ feel added to by the complete lack of any
cellphone signal. Beautiful indigenous trees grow along the base and the crags are quiet
except for the sound of the waterfall and the baboons. Climbs are shady earlier than
other sectors, most from 9 or10 onwards except for those at the Animal Farm Sector.

The landowner has graciously granted access on the basis that climbers absolutely stick
to the following rules:

- ONLY WALK IN BY THE APPROVED ROUTE - KEEP DOGS ON A LEAD AS
THERE ARE ANIMALS ON THE FARM - NO FIRES EVER - NO LITTER,
INCLUDING CIGARETTE BUTTS AND TOILET PAPER - DO NOT WALK IN
VIEW OF THE FARMHOUSE – DO NOT WALK OUT AFTER DARK…YOU
MAY BE CONFUSED FOR A THIEF AND SHOT (THIS IS A WORKING FARM)

APPROACH (see map on page 26). The walk in has been marked specifically to avoid
disturbing the owner, taking a short cut across the hill is absolutely not permitted and
actually does not save more than a minute or two. Start at the boom gate close to the
toilet block at Tranquilitas campsite, walk along the rough track for 250 metres until it
bends sharply to the left and there is a cairn in the grass. Cut across on grassy track 30
metres to a well-worn mountain bike trail, follow this for 230 metres to a large cairn on
right and cross grass to obvious place to easily step over the fence (cairns) onto a dirt
road. Walk 100 m along the road through wattle trees, when you exit the trees there is a
‘cow skull’ cairn (maybe the a cow skull is still there). From here:

- For the Corruption Crags, from the 'cow-skull cairn', head leftish (north east) towards
the cliff top. There is a lovely narrow gully (aka 'Narrow Gulley') to walk down. From
here the climbs are to the right (facing out). There is no real path and the ground is not
easy but there looks to be a few good lines. Another option is to abseil into the climbs,
either from the chains (which can be reached with care, from the top) or by slinging
boulders.

- For the Burning Man Walls from the ‘cow skull’ cairn, head rightwards (south)
following cairns and cattle tracks 450 metres up and down to a flat rock with a cairn by a
large wattle tree growing on the cliff top. Hiding behind this tree is an easy scramble
down, arriving at the east (right) end of the sector. The path along the base is good.

- For the Animal Farm Crags. These are the crags facing NW on the opposite side of the
valley (sunny except early morning and evening) Do not walk over the dam wall as we



25

must not walk on top of the cliffs there. Rather, walk in as for Burning Man Walls to end
of crag, make your way over the stream just past an old metal pump about 30m down
from the falls, through some thorns. Then up to the crags easily enough.



Corruption Crags 
- Much more broken, but with some superb walls and the
hardest slab in Boven! A bit of a bundu bash approach, or ab in. Climbs are described
from left to right.

POWER AND GLORY. 25 **** Unique pocketed orange wall. Can be seen from the
top and accessed by abseil, its on the section almost directly (a little to the south) in front
and below of the cow skull cairn. Or can be accessed by walking 180 m left (facing the
crag) from the 'Narrow Gulley' (see above), shortly after the ‘grey slabs'. FA J Theron.
Feb 2015. Hardware provided by Boven Fund/MCSA.

CLOSED PROJECT of Jahne Theron. A good 160 m from the narrow gully are the
unmistakable compact 40 metre wide ‘grey slabs’, with very few holds on it. Jahnes
Project takes the obvious weakness at its centre via some very hard moves on tiny holds.

THE WONDERLAND CRAGS

See map on page 34

This  major  area  is  without  a  doubt  the  most  popular  of  all  with  a  huge  variety  of
climbing, away from town and with wonderful views. The raise in altitude out of town
normally makes this area slightly cooler, assisted by a breeze from the valley below. The
crags and climbs are very easy to find and are between 5 and 15 minutes walk from the
parking. Unless you are staying at Tranquilitas, don’t park there, use the parking at
the farmhouse, it’s a shorter walk anyway.
Tranquilitas Crag
Home to some great easy and moderate climbs, getting lots of sun. The Creche is one
of the best places to take absolute beginners. HEIGHT: 12 - 25 Metres

ASPECT: Tranquilitas is visible from the road. It faces north-north-east and so is sunny
most of the time. It can be really pleasant to climb in the sun here on a cold winter’s day
when the rest of the Wonderland is in icy shade. Also on a summer day late afternoon (4
pm onwards) it is in shade, or on a cloudy day - these times can be perfect.

APPROACH
From Boven town: At the main intersection in town, with Roc ‘n Rope Adventures on
your  left,  turn  right  up  the  hill  past  the  hospital  and  past  The  Elandskrans  Mountain
Resort (closed). After a few kilometers the road turns into a dirt road and leads over a
small bridge then up a long hill. After 5 kilometres on the dirt road you can’t miss the
stone turrets of Tranquilitas. There is a ‘climbers parking’ sign. Park up this track, under
the trees. Walk back across the main gravel road and follow the path to the campsite.
Alternatively, (and only) if you are staying at the Tranquilitas Adventure Farm (chalets,
perma-tents or camping) you will walk from there.

From  the  Tranquilitas  campsite:  take  the  path  heading  northeast  through  the  grass,
starting  close  to  the  electricity  transformer.  At  the  cliff  edge  you  will  see  some  large
cairns (piles of rocks) which lead down left to an easy short scramble down to the cliffs.
Pass the well-chalked hard climbs of the Rubiks Cube Block (on the left) then the first
climb you will see is Caviars Whiskers in a large recess on the right. This is the right-
hand end of the crag (looking at the crag). The path leads along the base of the crags for
several hundred metres (10 minute’s walk) until you reach the leftmost lines. Climbs are
described from left to right (east to west).

Note. After heavy rain the dirt road from town can become very slippery and unless you
have a 4 x 4 you might get stuck. If you’re at the crag and heavy rain looks likely it’s
wise to head back to town while you can! The road dries very quickly, normally by 9 am
the following day if the rain has stopped.

ALS BELLS AREA

At the far East (left) end of the crag a selection of trad climbs can be found on the blocky
butressess. Beware of loose rock.



32


WHEN YOU NEED IT [ GPS: S25 40 30.6 E30 22 11.1] 17 ** [Trad] Scramble 10m
up the blocks left of the steep open book. Climb the obvious crack. FA: Gustav Janse van
Rensburg & Alard Hüfner 2003

ALS  BELLS 19  ****  [Trad]  The  obvious  undercut  open  book.  It  looks  harder  than  it
climbs.  Takes  good  gear.  This  and  other  climbs  here  are  in  shade  from  noon  in  the
summer. FA: Alard Hüfner & Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2003

RESPECT FOR THE BIG GUY  18 *** [Trad] Climbs the front nose of the buttress 5m
right of ALS BELLS. Climbs diagonally up left past the loose looking “big guy” and onto
the face. FA: Alard Hüfner & Mark Seuring 2003

SOFT SABIE MARK  22 *** [Trad] Climbs an arete up to the crack in the face above.
Starts 2m right of RFTBG.  FA: Mark Seuring, Marianne Schwankhart  & Karl Kritzinger

SYB.  Follows  the  crack  through  small  roof  2m  right  of  the  big  corner  with  an  offwidth
above. FA: Mark Seuring, Marianne Schwankhart & Karl Kritzinger 2003

THE HUFFING WARTHOG
23 *** [Trad, A]  The striking crack line. Fist size
higher up with chains on top. These can also be used for abbing after doing some of the
other routes. Thanks to Gareth Frost & Daryll Margetts who aided up here first and for
placing the anchors. FA: Alard Hüfner 2003

THE CRECHE

The very low angle slabs host a number of the easiest bolted lines at Boven. Ideal for
absolute  beginners.  Milou  can  be  used  as  a  scramble  out  from  the  crag  if  you  are
confident soloing a 9! Otherwise it’s quite a walk to get to this sector which should sort
out the babies from the grown-ups!

RETURN OF THE AVATAR 10 ** [6D] Gently scrambles up from left of the tree,
heading diagonally right to easily accessible chains. FA: Mel Janse van Rensburg 2011

SPIDATRIX 18 *** [9D] Starts left of MILOU. The route climbs the striking arete
halfway up the face and up to the ledge among some trees.

MILOU 9 *** [8D] Starts just left of the tree at the base of Crouching Tiger. This route
does  not  go  all  the  way  to  the  top  of  the  crag.  A  must  do,  especially  if  you  are  old
enough to walk. FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg & Charles Fourie 2007

CROUCHING TIGER 12 *** [12D] Starts on a block just right of the tree growing out

WOODCHOPPERS AND WATERBEARERS   22 *** [10D]  Climb up the right arete.
Avoid  using  opposite  side  of  chimney.  Then  move  right  onto  the  face  after  the  small
roof. FA: Rory Lowther  (BB) Chris Rudolph & Rory Lowther 2003

YELLOW  POLKA  DOT  25  ****  [11D]  A  rather  loose  few  metres  (careful)  of  easy
climbing leads to an appealing yellow-dotted headwall. Fun climbing becomes technical
higher up. FA: Alard Hüfner 2003

WHO’S LINE IS IT ANYWAY  23 **** [9D] Starts 8 m left of the Good and Evil arête

37

ELDORADO 28 **** [11D] One of the best lines at the crag. A sustained and sequence
of technical mastery takes you to the chains. Consensus is easy 28 (7c). Name written on
the rock. FA: Andrew Pedley 2004

INCA TRAIL 27 *** [11D] A slabby looking line on the golden wall between SWAT
Team  &  Eldorado.  The  line  weaves  its  way  through  a  series  of  balancy  moves.  FA:
Andrew Pedley, June 2009

S.W.A.T.  Team  24  ***  [10D]  A  lovely  intro  to  this  section  of  the  wall.  Amazingly
comfortable holds and great friction. Rebolted and upgraded from 23. Mantle onto the
initial protruding block and head up the water groove. Name written on the rock. FA:
Mark Millar & Marc Efune. BB: Mark Millar & Mike Garrard 2003

FEVER  29  **  [10D]  Start  on  a  big  block  and  climb  a  cruxy  4  bolts  over  a  bulge.

VISION THING 18 **** [16D,A] Starts 20m right of FEVER. Negotiate a small roof,
continue up and pull through the cruxy bulge. Switch style and enjoy the face climbing
to the chains. Important: To avoid rope drag, unclip the first bolt and use long sling on
second draw beneath the roof. 60m rope essential! FA: Wes Makovini Sep 2015

PEACEFUL  SLEEP    21  ***  [11D]  This  route  starts  at  the  base  of  a  huge,  well
established  two-stemmed  tree.  Climb  the  layback  under  a  small  roof,  using  the  finger

over onto the main wall. FA: Alard Hüfner 2006

BALANCE  OF  POWER  22  ***  [8D]  Takes  the  groove  just  left  of  ROC  RALLY.
Consensus seems to have brought this climb down to 22 from 24 but not a giveaway;

FUG 22 ***  New route well indicated on the rock. FA: G Frost and D Margetts. MCSA
bolts.

BEAUTY  IS  IN  THE  EYE  OF  THE  BELAYER  22  ***  [10D]  One  bolt  on  the  face
takes you through the trees with funky moves onto the face above and to the top of the
crag. A 60m rope is just long enough! FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg & Ed Febraury
2007

ENDLESS BLOWJOB 18 *** [12D] The well marked climb left of LITTLE BONSAI.
FA: G Frost and D Margetts. MCSA bolts.

Technical and fun climbing to a ledge above which you can top out on or ab in from
chains. FA: Gary Lowther 2003

the overlap. Join up with the final moves on Biogalactic Gargleblaster. FA: Gustav Janse
van Rensburg 2003.

BIOGALACTIC GARGLEBLASTER 20 *** [8D] Start 8m right of GRUNT. Dynamic
start onto jugs can also be done statically if tall (to cheat: use the tree or traverse from
the right). Climb a few  meters to a ledge, then some  face  moves to chains. Awesome
photo  opportunity  of  climb,  from  ledges  out  right  of  chains.  FA:  Rory  Lowther  2003

RUBIKS CUBE BOULDER

The  free-standing  leaning  boulder  on  the  left  as  descending  to  Tranquilitas  Crags  is
home to some hard bouldery climbs.

PIT  FIGHTER  31  ****  Direct  version  of  STITCH  IT.  From  the  obvious  slopey  right
hand side pull keep going straight up, slightly left on small holds. Leave the chalk bag
behind. A power test-piece. FA: Andrew Pedley April 2009

STITCH IT 29 *** [6D] Halfway down the standard scramble, look left. The route pulls
straight up the middle of the face on the leaning free-standing boulder. Move right at the

believe move. FA: Dewald Kloppers 2008

RUBIK'S CUBE 26 - 28 *** [6D] Start on the two obvious crimps do two dynos and a
couple of hard moves, nice route. Harder if you use less holds on the arête like the FA;
opened at 28. FA: Dewald Kloppers 2008

Baboon Buttress


A variety of easy and intermediate grade climbs of mixed quality, some of which stay
dry even during very heavy rain. HEIGHT: 15 - 25 Metres ASPECT : East-south-east.
(shade after about 11 am)

APPROACH See map on page 34.  As for Tranquilitas Crag, then:


A.

B.

from the parking at the farmhouse, cross over the road through the Tranquiltas
Adventure Farm entrance, after a few metres take the path on the left towards
the cliffline. After 100 metres the path forks. Take the smaller right hand fork
down to the cliff top. Scramble down the obvious blocky descent gulley (past
some short climbs). At the base of the gulley, head left for 10 metres and you
will see the obvious crack of Grizzly bear.

from  the  Tranquilitas  Adventure  Farm  camping,  take  the  path  heading
northwestwards from the corner of the field, which initially follows a couple of
electricity  poles.  Keep  on  the  main  path  and  it  becomes  a  mountain  bike
trail/road which winds down  to a waterfall and a small bridge. Cross this and
follow the path (past the climb LOGGER SPORTS) through the forest  for a
couple  hundred  metres.  Don’t  recross  the  stream  at  the  next  bridge,  that’s  a
mountain  bike  trail.  After  about  200  metres  the  path  arrives  at  the  gully
(approach A) and then a short wall with the obvious layback crack of Grizzly
Behr. The first climbs start 40 metres or so left of this.

Climbs are described from left to right:

LOGGER  SPORTS  18  *  A  climb  by  itself  on  the  walk  in.  There  is  a  ‘death  block’
halfway up whichg we tried to lever off but did not succeed. Be careful or avoid it. FA:
Mike Behr and Stephan Isabeck, 2011.

Then 50 m or so further:

PAPSAK  22  *  [6D]  Anyone  have  the  details  for  this  route?  Goes  up  the  arete  left  of
AFTER THOUGHT's corner FA: Unknown

LOOPDOP  17  **  [7D]  Up  middle  of  face  left  of  AFTER  THOUGHT's  corner.  FA:

A.S 14 * [6D] Climbs the chimney just right of AFTER THOUGHT's corner. A grovel
but a good lesson in entry level chimney climbing. FA: Jan Bradley 2011.

DIABLO 27 *** (7D) Climb the bouldery face 5 meters right of afterthought. Intense
start with a interesting finish. FA: Evan Margetts, July 2011. MCSA bolts.

The  following  few  climbs  start  in  the  descent  gulley  and  from  the  half-height  ledge
accessed from the gulley.

RAPTOPHILIA 31 **** [8D] Start with your feet on the lowest boulders, preclip first
bolt. Enjoy the intricate footwork and desperate stabbing for holds. Finish rightwards to
for most fun. Low in grade. FA: Brian Weaver, April 2011.

PSYCHE  WARD  31  ***  [5D].  Starts  off  the  boulder.  Climb  up  and  pre-clip  the  2nd
draw. Dead-point your way to the chains. FA. Andrew Pedley Jan 2011. MCSA bolts.

On the other side of the gulley:

BABOONS IN BOARDSHORTS 14 ** [7D] As descending the gulley, this easy climb
is on the left and angles up leftwards on grey slab. FA: Kieren Davies, Brad Davies &

main ledge. FA: Mike Behr & Christopher Dabrowski 2006

JUST BEHRLY 29 *** [8D]. Can you hold the smallest holds in Boven? Starts up the
tree  right  of  Grizzly  Bear.  Clip 1st bolt  then use  the  tree  to  gain  the  good  rail  up  and
right. Move left then up to a good hold to clip the second bolt…..now brace your fingers
and hang on, just barely. FA: Andrew Pedley 2011.

route is in the obvious corner chimney. FA: Alard Hüfner 2000

PYGMY PARTY 28 **** [13D] Starts as for KANNIE-BALLISTIC but head straight
through the roofs. FA: Mark Seuring 2011

KANNIE-BALLISTIC  27 *** [12D] Start at the base of the chimney that becomes UP
ALARD'S  CRACK.  Follow  bolts  left  and  up  then  step  over  and  continue  diagonally
right after the steep section. Take long draws for bolts no. 3, 4 and 7 if you want to take
out a bit of rope drag. FA: Philippe Gaboriaud and Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2006



LEGENDS 25 ** [6D] Short face climb below the big roof, rails out right a bit after the
final bolt. Stays dry in heavy rain. FA: Mike Cartwright 2006

Head up the crack toward the surprisingly solid excrement then up left onto the technical
face. FA: Alard Hufner 2007

SOUR GRAPES 24 *** [13D] Route climbs the face right of Sweet Plum. Climb past
the  chains  of  TBTR  and  goes  all  the  way  to  the  top.  FA:  Ken  Thrash  October  2008.
MCSA bolts.

THORN  BETWEEN  THE  ROSES  12  ***  [7D]  Starts 2m  right  of  Sweet  Plumb,  just
right of the obvious off-width crack and climb the arête. FA: Darryl Margetts  August
2008. MCSA bolts.

TWICE IN  A BLUE MOON: 18  *** [7D] Route climbs the off-width crack between
THORN  BETWEEN  THE  ROSES  and  WILD  FIRE.  FA:  Ken  Thrash  and  Darryl

THE BOVENATOR 28 ***** (11D) Starts by the black streak. A tricky compression
start lead to lots and lots of fun. This is your chance to be The Bovenator. Stays dry in
heavy rain. Solid at the grade. FA: Andrew Pedley August 2010. MCSA bolts.





47

BOVENATRIX  28  **    Start  on  the  blocky  arête  right  of  Bovenator.  Up  past  some
reachy cruxy stuff then with sustained interest up the face to the chains. Part bolted by
Mark Millar, the rest by Greg Borman. FA Greg Borman 2013.

DREAMERS 23 *** [11D] Main recess to major ledge out right, longer route but 60m
gets you back. Stays dry in heavy rain. FA: Christopher Dabrowski 2007. The extension
is partially bolted and is an open project.

HYPOPNEA 25 *** (6D,A) Weird but a cool outing! From the ledge at the chains of
Dreamers (23), un-clip the chains and keep clipping diagonally left, breathing slowly..go
way left..then up  to the chains. If you do this and Dreamers as one pitch, you need a
70m rope and tie knots in the ends! FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2013

NOT-DA-MAMA 23 ** [14D] 5m right of Dreamers and ends on the same ledge, but
has  its  own  chains.  To  avoid  rope  drag  use  a  longer  draw  on  the  7th  bolt  and  once

July 2008. MCSA bolts.

HEY  MAMA  16  *  [6D]  Starts  about  2m  to  the  right  of  Not-da-Mamma.  FA:  Darryl

AFRICAN RAIN  25 *** [14D] Start in between the 2 drips between the routes "Hey
Mama"  and "Ice Scream Sundae". Follow the thin diagonal crack up to the ledge and
continues straight up the head wall. FA: Ken Thrash March 2011. MCSA bolts.

ICE SCREAM SUNDAE 22 *** [16D] Up the first 3 bolts of S.T.P. then traverse left to
the arete, then up to a ledge. Continue up the left side of the large open book to the roof
and up to the chains. NB: a 70 m rope does NOT get you to the ground. Use the lower
off's on the ledge. To avoid rope drag unclip the 3rd bolt once you've clipped the 4th.
Can also be done in 2 pitches. FA: Ken Thrash January 2011. MCSA bolts.

STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING (S.T.P). 23 *** [17D] A long and varied climb with great
exposed arête finale. FA: Glenn Harrison 2007 .

SWEET CHILD OF MINE 28 (14D). ** Not for the person who climbs less than 30!
Some  exposure  and  a  worrying  clip  or  two,  though  if  you  are  capable,  it’s  great  fun!
Some loose rock on lower section and massive hollow flake at top of the corner. Starts at
the base of a steep rightward trending corner amongst the trees. Climb this with effort
then moves leftwards to a slab and rest, before tackling a technical and airy arete. FA.
Clinton Martinengo October 2010

PASHASH MADALA. 33. Two pitches. The first is easy the second is very hard. Best
to try the top pitch off a hanging belay (two bolts). Some outrageously thin and techy
moves up the short vertical wall. Unrepeated ATOW. FA Clinton Martinengo. 2013.

ROLIHLAHLA (AKA The Overlord). 32 or 33. Need confrmation. Bovens latest cover
shot. Yes, it really does cross the big blank face! Gallop up the wall left of Butterfly, to a
no hands rest on the left, then across the face with great difficulty. The hard bit is the
first  1/3.  Opened  at  35  downgraded  to  32  and  now  maybe  33  as  some  footholds  got
smaller. Take up slings.. and your strongest fingers. Joins Butterfly for the last 2-3 bolts.

BUTTERFLY  PITCH  ONE  26  ***  Great  climb  to  chains  below  the  massive  roof.
Stunning moves up the corner and through roof, easier than it looks! FA: Alard Hufner.

BUTTERFLY PITCH TWO. 27 *** The crack in the sky! Can abseil in to the ledge, or
access by climbing Pitch 1. Great photos from the top of the crag. FA: Andrew Pedley
2007.

BIG BUTTERFLY 28 **** [lots] Ground to top in one giant and stunning pitch. Moves
right after chains. Use two ropes (or both ends of same rope) and drop one at half height
ledge (up and right of half height chains). FA: Andrew Pedley 2007.  BB: Mark Seuring

The next several climbs are new additions to the crag, providing some long easy climbs
of quality, bolted in a season of pscyche by Gustav!

GEM SQUASH 22 *** [12D,A] Starts on a small buttress almost touching the path 30m
left of the MONSTER cave. Blast through the roofs right of the massive wild fig tree.
FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2014 Bolts sponsored by MCSA!

BUTTERNUT 19 *** [10D,A] The second pitch of GEM SQUASH. Traverse left from
the  finishing  ledge  of  GEM  SQUASH  and  be  prepared  for  some  well  deserved
ambiance. Can be done in one massive pitch with enough extender slings below the first
set of chains. You need at least a 70m rope to do both pitches and reach the ground. A
60m rope will be just good enough to abseil from the final chains. FA: Gustav Janse van
Rensburg 2014 Bolts sponsored by MCSA!

LEG-O 23 *** [14D,A] Starts below an obvious fin-like feature through some rock fig
branches  left  of  JENGA.  Take  care  of  small  sections  with  precariously  loose  looking
rocks. FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2014 Bolts sponsored by MCSA!

JENGA 18 **** [12D,A] Shares a start with TOOLBOX, tending left at the 3rd bolt. A
true pump-fest at the grade. Use the lonely fixed 'biner out right to make cleaning this
route easier, or back clean it. FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2014 Bolts sponsored by
MCSA!

TOOLBOX 21 **** [17D,A] Starts 15m left of Rodan in a break through the foliage.
Unbelievable  that  this  line  has  been  overlooked.  FA:  Philippe  Gaboriaud  and  Gustav
Janse van Rensburg 2014

THE ENGAGEMENT CRUISE 21 *** [Trad]. The first line on this face, probably now partially
occupied by Toolbox (above). Scramble up left past the start of Rodan, to a narrow ledge. Start on the
left of the ledge, just left of the stacked blocks. Straight up a short face, though the overlap and up to
below the roof. Rail left to the break in the roof, pull up to the next rail, and then move back right
until  you  can  pull  up  onto  the  grey  ramp.  Move  slightly  left  and  up  the  narrow,  brown  corner,
stepping right at the top. Finish up the face between the aloes to the top. FA: Richard Halsey and Tim
Dunnett, May 2012.

The God No! Wall


The biggest steep wall at Boven and home to most of the hardest climbs. One of SA’s
best sport crags.  The  sector  starts  where  the  crag  becomes  much  bigger  and  steeper!
HEIGHT: 25 - 40 metres. ASPECT: Faces properly South East. First crag to get shade.
from 10.30 am onwards.

APROACH See map on page 26


A.  Access as for Baboon Buttress which rambles on for about 100 metres, keep

B.

walking along the base of the cliff until you reach the obvious leaning walls.

if you are at Hallucinogen Wall, take the zig-zagging path that leads down and
leftwards  starting  in  the  vicinity  of  Bongoleo.  After  a  few  minutes  you  will
pass the Little Red Wall then the Disciple Wall.


Climbs are described from left to right:

RODAN 33 ***** (13D). The leftmost line up the long leaning face... At the ledge 8
metres  up,  look  out  over  the  forest,  take  a  deep  breath  then  immerse  yourself  in  25
metres of pumping orange rock-karate. FA. Andrew Pedley – January 2011. Use a 70 m
rope

GODZILLA 32 ***** [14D] Boven’s 'King Line'. Climb up behind the tree to a ledge
then the climbing starts. Up to a shake at a half height then a wicked 10-move boulder
problem through the wonderful smooth rock, to good holds. One of the greatest climbs.
It is possible to move off-line to a jug far right just before the crux but this is a kop-out
and would be graded 30/31. FA. Andrew Pedley - September 2008. Use a 70 m rope

MONSTER  29  *****  [16D]  The  “baddest”  and  steepest  29  at  Boven!!  The  only  line
with ring bolts. Not many small holds on this one, but an absolute pump-fest. Slightly
harder (and even better) since the chockstone fell out but still 29. FA: Andrew Pedley
2006 BB: Alard Hufner. Use a 70 m rope!

THE BEAST 31  ***** [16D] Start up Monster and move right at the 4th bolt. Some
funky  moves  through  the  white  roof,  get  a  rest  in  the  'man  trap'  then  finger  jugs
diagonally to the chains. Low in the grade if you use all the latest tricks. Use slings on
the bolts below the roof to reduce drag. FA: Andrew Pedley - March 2008 Use a 70 m
rope

MUTATION 32 **** Not the Steve Mclure 9a but pretty cool. Climbs Beast until 2/3rds
height then shoot straight up the strenuous crack. A nice variation on the original. 31 if
you can get the jams right? FA: Brian Weaver, June 2012. Use a 70 m rope

SPACE CADET 30 **** [18D]. A massive climb for the space cadets amongst us. A bit
of everything from technical arête, burly roof, gnarly crack, exposed handrailing, leaning
face..a fantastic ride...Use long slings on the 3 bolts before/in the roof section - that way
drag is negligible. There are half height lower off chains. FA: Andrew Pedley - March
2009. Use a 70 m rope

HEAVENS ABOVE PROJECT. Open project, an extension of Freak Show, through the
massive overhangs. Only 2-3 metres unsolved to date. Could avoid the Freakshow crux
by branching left off Juggernaut. Bolted by Andrew Pedley.

FREAK-SHOW 28 ** [12D] Start 2 m left of Freak-on. Climbs the wall just to right of
the black water streak (always damp) via thin moves then busts through the roof with
effort. Chains are below the huge roofs. FA Andrew Pedley July 2008

JUGGERNAUT 30 *** [12D] Shares the first 3 bolts of Freak-On and then continues
straight up through 3 roofs with a hard crux after clipping the last bolt (which has a fixed
quickdraw). FA Marc Flex Efune June 2009 (BB Mark Millar).

FREAK-ON 24  ***** [12D] Mega classic! Crimps to the ledge then move right then
take  the  rightwards  slanting  weakness  and  much  pump.  The  route  remains  dry  during
heavy rain but may seep a little. PLEASE brush the holds when you are done; the climb
gets cakedand gets no rain. FA: Andrew Pedley - Jan 2008

CHOCOLATE ÉCLAIR 27 ** [4D] A two bolt boulder problem. Something to throw
yourself at when the rain won’t let you climb anywhere else. FA: Philippe Gaboriaud Jan
2007 BB: Mike Cartwright

WHO NEEDS LUCKY COWS (aka death by chocolate) 31 *** (12D) Climb Chocolate
Eclair  then  continue  over  the  roof  with  a  grunt,  then  up  the  headwall.  Some  very
satisfying and crimptastic moves. The route remains dry during heavy rain. FA: Daniel
Gebel , September 2009.

ABOVE  AND  BEYOND  OPEN  PROJECT.  Open  project  through  the  massive
horizontal roofs above Lucky Cows, involves a Font 8A+ dyno..BB. Matt Bush October
2011.

CLOSED PROJECT OF Sarel. The obvious nice and wall above. Looks climable, until
you try get into the niche!

DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS 26 **** [13D] 25 if you can use your feet. This route
starts  in  the  corner  just  right  of  Chocolate  Eclair.  Much  better  than  it  looks,  a  great
climb. Start up the ramp and into the long overhanging corner behind the trees 20 metres
right of Freak-on. Dry in all weather. FA: Mike Cartwright Jan 2007



53

TOKOLOSIE 30 **** [14D] Sustained with lots and lots of footwork. Easy if good at
the latter. Starts off the big ledge up and right of the start of Dungeons. Climb left to get
into then up the corner of Dungeons, after 3-4 bolts, break out right through the small
roof. Dance up the headwall with a pump. Shares chains of Butcher. Use long slings for
the 3 bolts below the roof. FA: Andrew Pedley April 2009.

THE  BACKCOUNTRY  BUTCHER  31  ***  (13D)  Starts  off  the  same  ledge  as
Tokolosie, or from the ground. Up the orange vertical wall past hard moves including a
very defensive little hold, take a rest at the ledge then up the leaning headwall via some
real sequency climbing. Don’t get butchered. FA: Andrew Pedley Jan 2009.

CHANGING  GEARS  24,23,25  ***  [12D]  This  is  a  3  pitch  route  that  takes  the  first
section of JACK OF ALL TRADES with one new bolt out left onto a ledge. Although it
is tempting (yet possible) to do in one long pitch, it is more fun to break it up. A 50m
rope will work as all the stances have rap anchors. Pitches 2 & 3 were opened on trad.
FA: Jens Ricther & Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2006 BB: Gustav 2009

JACK OF ALL TRADES 30 ***** [15D] The crackline on the left of big smooth 35-
metre wall. The original God No! classic. Benchmark 8a. Hard for the short.  70 m rope
needed. FA: Tessa Little 1998 (BB) Mike Hislop

JABBERWOCKY 32 **** [14D] The route up the middle of the face, was SA’s hardest
climb  for  many  years  and  still  one  of  the  hardest  lines  in  Boven.  Solid  at  the  grade,
opened  at  33.  Steel  fingers  and  ace  footwork  are  required.  70  m  rope  needed.  FA:
Richard Lord 1993 . RB 2011 using MCSA bolts.

VORPAL  SWORD  31  ****  [16D]  The  one  that  killed  the  Jabberwocky.  Crimpy  and
gymnastic  climbing  to  the  right  of  Jabberwocky,  shares  first  bolt  with  Hell  Yeah.  An
unbelievable  climb,  one  of  best  sport  pitches  in  SA.  Need  a  70  m  rope.  FA:  Andrew
Pedley May 2008

HELL  YEAH!  27  ****  [17D]  A  very  long  climb  which  takes  the  long  corner
immediately  right  of  Vorpal  Sword  (shares  the  first  bolt).  Not  sustained  but  a  superb
line. A popular route. Belayer must keep rope close at the ‘3rd crux’ to avoid impact with
the ledge! Need a 70 m rope FA: Marc Efune Dec 2006

ROCK-CHUKA-CHICK  23 **** [17D] Starts about 10m right of JABBERWOCKY. A
low  crux  then  fun  climbing  but  a  bit  ledgy.  Opened  at  24  as  went  direct  where  most
people skirt left at crux. FA: Marianne Schwankhart 1999

PURGATORY  PERHAPS?  25  ***  [14D,A]  Between  Roc  Chucka  Chic  and  Big  Bad
Wolf. NB: This route is 36m long - even with a 70 m rope (tie a a knot in the end!!) the
belayer has to climb up onto the first ledge in order to lower the climber. FA: Marc Flex
Efune 2015. Hardware provided by MCSA/Boven Fund.






54



BIG  BAD  WOLF  25  ****  [17D]  10m  right  of  ROCK-CHUKA-CHICK  is  another
looong  route,  this  one  with  some  fingery  technical  cruxes.  FA:  Alard  Hüfner  1999

BURNING SPEAR 28 ** [17D] Start up the first 5 bolts of Big Bad Wolf then head
right up some good sequential climbing that gets harder as you get higher. A rest before
the crux detracts from the climb. A 70m rope is required to get all the way down. FA:
Marc Efune Oct 2009 BB: Reiny zee German 2009

ALICE IN GRANNYLAND 24 *** [16D] Some pleasant face climbing leads to a high
crux that if solved correctly is rather easy for the grade. This route is fairly long at 35
odd meters. FA: Greg Watkins 1998

The Disciple Wall (really an extension of God No!)



Keep walking along the base of the crag from the God No Wall and around a corner you
will arrive at a very  appealing east facing vertical  wall which is home to some lovely
sustained  easy climbs. Some of the best moderate climbs in Boven. Shade from 11
onwards.

Climbs  are  described  from  left  to  right.  The  starts  of  the  climbs  (first  2-4  bolts)  are
somewhat interchangeable.

BITTERGAL  22  ***  [14D]  Starts  to  the  left  of  the  tree.  A  tricky  looking  first  few
metres on is on dolerite (an igneous rock),  changing to quartzite after the 3rd bolt. FA:
Greg Borman Feb 2009

DENDROPHILIA  21  ***  [13D,A]  Just  right  of  BITTERGAL  is  a  recess.  Climb  the
bolts using the tree to get onto the fun stuff. Colin's grab-tree is a rather unique feature
on  this  climb,  lets  hope  it  stays  there.  The  name  is  related  to  the  love  of  trees.  FA:
Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2015

THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (also known as Brolloks) 19 ***** [14D] Since being
bolted this route has become very popular and must be a contender for one of the best
easy climbs in Boven. After the 3rd bolt, move left then up and up; sustained. A 60 m
rope  is  needed.  FA  (on  trad):  Stewart  Middlemiss  &  I  Schwartz  1998.  (BB  Greg
Borman)

GOODWILL VAN DIE ZOELOES (also known as Groenie Die Drakie) 21 **** [13D]
Just right of Brolloks, great, bit cruxier than Brollocks. Climb up to the ledge then move
left after 4th bolt, and up bolts up to your left. Can also use the Brollocks start. FA: (on
trad), by Ian Manson & G Shepston 1992. (BB Ken Thrash 1999). MCSA bolts.

SAREL SEEMONSTER 18 *** [12D] Just right of Groenie die Drakie. Again, climb 4
bolts then move left and up. Cruxy. FA: Ken Thrash June 2009. MCSA bolts.



55

LUCY 17 *** [12D] The right most line. Clip first 3-4 bolts of Sarel Seemonster then
move right and up, finishing below the big bushy tree. FA: A Margetts and E Margetts
and Daryl Margetts 2010. MCSA bolts.

The Little Red Wall

This wall is dark red in colour and can be seen through the trees about 50 m up and right
of the Disciple Wall. Some pretty cool climbs here and it’s only 2 minutes from the God
No! Wall. HEIGHT: 15 - 20 Metres. ASPECT: East-north-east.

APPROACH See map on page 34


A.

if you are at Hallucinogen Wall, take the zig-zagging path that leads down and
leftwards starting in the vicinity of Bongoleo, in which case the first wall you
will reach is the Little Red Wall.


B.  Continue up right another 30 metres from the Disciple Wall (approach as for

God No! Wall)

Climbs are described from left to right:

GRANNIE'S COTTAGE  25 *** [8D] This route was the old 'Digiridoo Project'. FA:
Matthew Murison 1998 (BB) Rob Cormak & Chris Vandereyalt 1998

LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD 24 *** [9D] A super little climb, a great first 24. FA:
Tessa Little (BB) Matthew Murison 1998

THE  LOAN  ARRANGER  25  ***  [Trad]  Just  right  of  LRRH.  Climb  the  crack  in  the
middle of the wall, first diagonally right to a thread, then left and up. Hack your way to the
top. Don't forget your spade!  FA: Stewart Middlemiss, Mike Hislop 1992

HIM  SPEAK  WITH  FORKED  TONGUE  23  *  [Trad]  Trad  line  just  right  of  THE
LOAN ARRANGER. FA: Stewart Middlemiss & I Schwartz 1998

HALONGISMASHLONG  21****  [13D]  This  (rude)  line  climbs  through  the  overlap
from a corner, 15m right of LRRH. FA: Alard Hüfner 1999

















56

Hallucinogen Wall


The most popular wall around for easy and moderate climbs, better than Baboon
Butress for up to 26 . Climbs are of relatively short stature but some are of excellent
quality.  A  good  place  to  hone  skills  required  for  bigger  and  better  things.  Climbs  are
starting to become a little squeezed-in which can detract from existing climbs; so before
you  bolt  another  line,  consider  if  it  is  really  necessary…HEIGHT:  5  -  18  Metres.
ASPECT: East and south east. Sunny until 11 ish, but variable as there are some corners
and shadier faces.



APPROACH (see map page 34)

A.  From the parking at the farmhouse, cross over the road through the Tranquiltas
Adventure Farm entrance, after a few metres take the path on the left towards
the  cliff  line….Follow  this  excellent  path  for  350  metres  until  you  reach  a
small white (faded Mountain Club of South Africa) sign. Here, leave the main
path and head down along the base of the small cliffs. Keep on walking along
the base until you arrive at the climbs.


B.  From  the  Tranquilitas  camping,  take  the  track  leading  down  into  the  little
bushy  valley  starting  close  to  chalet  No.  2.  Before  the  main  road  and  the
entrance to Tranquilitas an obvious path leads off on the right, towards the cliff
line. Take this path and follow it  this as described above.


To get to the right-hand end of the crag approach as above, pass the small white MCSA
sign and keep walking along the top of the cliff, pass the memorial for Heiko Tillwick
and after another 100 m there is a cairn on the right. Take the path on the right which
descends  to  the  cliff  top.  After  40  metres  turn  sharply  right  onto  a  small  path,  which
doubles  back  towards  the  south,  past  a  wooden  barrier  and  to  a  small  gulley  at  the
(climbers) right end of the Hallucinogen crag.

The Superbowl

One of the best crags, all grades from moderate to 33. Hosts two of South Africa’s most
famous routes, Snapdragon and Lotter’s Desire.

HEIGHT: 18 - 30 Metres

ASPECT:  Northeast-facing.  Sunny  until  almost  midday,  especially  Snapdragon.
Lotter’s  Desire  enjoys  shade  earlier.  The  big  roofs  work  well  for  shelter  during  rain
storms.


APPROACH (See map on page 34)


A.  As for Hallucinogen Crag but keep walking along the cliff top, past the Heiko
Tillwick memorial another 100 metres there is a cairn (pile of stones) on the
right from which a small path leads down toward to cliff top. You will arrive at
the  top  of  a  buttress,  look  left  and  you  get  a  great  view  of  Lotter’s  Desire,
Snapdragon and the others! The path leads down on the left into the trees and
along the base of the crags. Pass the Reunion Wall and after a few minutes you
will arrive at a clearing at the base of Snapdragon.


B.  The right hand side of the crag can also be accessed from beyond right side of
the crag. Approach as above but walk another 300 metres along the main cliff-
top path and leave the main trail by a cairn, take the right fork and follow the
cliff top until you can see a small square Mountain Club sign at the top of a
gulley. Descend the gulley by the recently-made steps and rocks you get to a
T-juntion at the crag-base trail. Turn right, past some drips and you soon arrive
at the climbs around Teen Spirit.

Climbs are described from left to right:

KIMCHI    27  ***  [11D]  Up  the  tricky  steep  face  then  some  easier  climbing  before  a
testing finish. The extra bolts at the penultimate bolt are not the chains, just a mistake by
the bolter. Solid 7b+.  FA: Dan Honeymann 2007

classic, ‘Snapdragon’ 29. Photo by Micky Wiswedel



DOUG  IN  THE  YELLOW  HOUSE    26  ****  [13D] Starts  on tree  roots  20  m  left  of
Snapdragon. Tenuous laybacks leads to great climbing through the roofs to the chains.
Really good and not a giveaway! FA: Jens Richter & Bine Tittel 2005

COACH 25 *** (12D) Dedicated to Heiko Tillwick - Rest in Peace, Coach. Start up the
roots  about  10  m  left  of  Snapdragon.  Some  awkward  fingery  cruxes  keep  your  brain
busy. FA: Marc 'Flex' Efune 2011. BB: Tim Dunnett and Dirk Smith.

FULL  ANIMAL 27  **** [14D,A] Several  metres left of Snapdragon, right of Coach.
Use slings on the three bolts after the half-height rest. Remember to go full animal on the
lip of the roof. FA: Hector Pringle 2014. MCSA bolts.

A  LIFE  IN  ORANGE  -  OPEN  PROJECT  (34/35?)  Tried  by  a  few  strong  locals  and
foreigners. One really reachy awkward section!

Clip the first couple of bolts on Frazzle then move left and up on small holds. Just when
you think you have pulled hard enough.. the crux appears; a long move from a break.
Reach will help. An amazing line. BB. Andrew Pedley 2012. MCSA bolts.




70

FRAZZLE  33 *** [15D] The blankness just left of Snapdragon. A couple of extremely
poor holds on the face lead to easier ground. Opended at 31 – did some holds fall off?!
FA: Paul Brouard 2000 (BB) Roger Nattrass & Matt Murison.

SNAPDRAGON  29  *****  [13D]  SA’s  most  famous  sport  climb.  It  offers  superb
endurance climbing and requires plenty of finesse. It is on every visitor’s ticklist and is
starting  to  become  very  well  used.  Please  brush  the  holds  when  you  are  done.  FA:
Richard Lord & Mike Hislop 1992

HACK AND SLAY 31 *** [16D] Starts 6m right of Snapdragon and tackles the lovely
looking  smooth  open  corner  using  some  rather  small  holds.  Hard  for  the  short.  FA:
Richard Lord 1994







THE  NEXT  GENERATION  33  ****  (12D,A)  The  route  previously  known  as  'The
Broject' starts up the choss pillar 10 m right of Snapdragon. A short easy face leads into
Boven's answer to Rocklands roof bouldering. Get creative (and strong!) and enjoy the
wild horizontal ride. FA: Marc Flex Efune, December 2012, BB Dewald Kloppers.

GIANTS  27  ***  [12D]  Starts  about  30  metres  right  of  Snapdragon  up  some  loose
looking (but solid) rock. A hard crux (knocking on 7c) unless you can jamit... FA: Mike
Cartwright 1993

KARFOEFELING 26 **** [13D] Awesome. Starts on Rude Bushman or Welcome to
Ovamboland, then go left and up to pass some overlaps,  finishing ¾ height chains. A
popular first 26. FA: Mark Seuring & Alard Hüfner 2004

LOSLAPPIE LINK-UP 28 **** (15D) The line that should have been here first! Start up
Welcome to Ov’land for 2-3 bolts then move left onto Kerfoefeling; then after clipping 2
bolts  on  the  face  above  the  last  roof/overlap  section,  move  back  onto  Ov’land  at  the
juggy break (rest) on the slabby part. Then load your forearms and blast up the incredible
leaning headwall to the top of the crag! FA: Wesley Black, October 2010.

WELCOME TO OVAMBOLAND 31 **** (15D) Blasts straight up to top of the crag
via awkward pulls in the roof. Opened using the left sequence (impossible for the short)
at the crux but a sequence on the right is possible. FA: Andrew Pedley, October 2010.
MCSA bolts.

RUDE BUSHMAN  24 ***** [15D] This route starts 3m left of  Lotters Desire starting
with a little overlap then heads rightwards into a niche, then up and left through a small
roof. Low in grade, probably 6c+. FA: Alard Hüfner 1998

HARD  NORMAL  DADDY    25  **    [10D]  Climb  the  obvious  corner  right  of  Rude
Bushman. FA: Dan Honeyman 2007.

LOTTER'S DESIRE 27 ***** [11D] The amazing orange wall. Five stars for the beauty
of the line, and the climbing is pretty good too. Tricky start (easier on the left) then up

MCSA bolts.

HYPERTENSION  30  ****  [13D]  A  brilliant  climb,  so  unique!  Requires  a  bit  of
everything - stamina, finger strength, reach, excellent footwork, so much fun. Easy 8a..
FA: Andrew Pedley 2005

TUGELA  BLUE  27  ***  [12D]  This  route  blasts  through  the  roofs  on  jugs,  heading
slightly right. Pre clipping the 3rd bolt and unclipping bolts 1 and 2 avoids rope drag.
FA: Alard Hüfner 1998



OUT ON A LIMB 26 **** [10D] A super line!! A bolt added in 2012 to make the start
less  scary.  Walk  out  along  the  left  limb  of  the  big  fig  tree.  Fight  through  the  initial
overhang  and  fire  up  the  headwall  above  to  the  chains  with  a  distressing  pump.  FA:
Mark Millar 2006

SOUL MANDATE 25 ** [11D] Start between the fork of the White tree about 5m left
of  Miss  McKinley.  A  thuggish  start  leads  to  some  good  climbing  above.  FA:  Mark
Millar 2004

MISS MCKINLEY 23 *** [9D] 30 m right of Lotters Desire. Starts on bouldery moves
just left of a bushy tree. FA: Alard Hüfner 1998

THE DOOMSDAY DEVICE 26 **** (13D) Start up the first 5 bolts of Miss Mckinley
and then head right and up past some strenuous sidepulling. FA: Marc 'Flex' Efune 2012.
MCSA bolts.

STRATA 32 **** [14D]. Doesn’t look hard from below but an absence of any useful
holds on the headwall gives plenty of spice. Solid 8b. Starts just left of Tripolactic.  FA:
Paul Brouard 2001 (BB) Matthew Murison

TRIPOLACTIC FAIRYTALES 27 **** [10D] Up the technical face then right-facing
corner above. Was 27 then 26, now definately 27.... FA: Will Watkins 1998 (BB) Darryl
Margetts & Matt Murison. New chains and bolts 1-5 (Feb 2011)

BEEHIVE    12  *  [15D]    Just  right  of  TRIPOLACTIC  FAIRYTALES  there  is  a  tree
growing on the rock. The route starts right of the roots. Move leftward toward the recess
above and then up the wall to the left. Take care of the bees. FA: Greg Devine & Darryl
Margetts 1996

TREE HOUSE 20 * [14D] Goes through the tree roots as for BEEHIVE to the recess.
Take care of the bees.  FA: Darryl Margetts & Greg Debvine 1996

growing up the cliff. FA: Mark Seuring 1999

HALLUCENOGENIC  TOREADOR    27  ****  [13D]  Quality!  Do  the  dyno,  rest  then
either power gaston or use your brain. FA: C Nicole 1997 (BB) Darryl Margetts

BRAIN  DAMAGED  22  ***  [12D]  Newish  route  to  the  right  of  Hallucinagenic
Toreador. FA: Philippe Gaboriaud & Vince 2006









SLEEPLESS TAD 22 *** [5D,N,A] About 10m right of the tree roots is a bolt at 5-6m.
You need extra natural gear. Follow the two bolts and crack to overhang. Some of the
bolts removed in 2014 so may not be possible. FA: Darryl Margetts & Martin Seegers
1992

CLUB  TROPICANA COCONUTS  24  *** [9D]  Up the middle of the  wall, about 8
meters left of Glen.  FA: Sybren van der Leij 1999

LE SKETCH 23 ** [11D] The route starts just to the left of GLEN and fires through the
small roof 5m below the top of the crag. Some smooth rock and reach moves low down!
FA: Philippe Gaboriaud & Vince 2003

GLEN    21  ***  [14D].  Overbolted  but  fun.  FA:  Darryl  Margetts  1998.  A  great
combination, often referred to as ‘Le Combo’ (22); start up Glen then move left onto Le
Sketch on the midway ledge. Place a long draw before moving onto Le Sketch.

INTO THE BLACK  21 ** [15D]  Just left of Precision Feather. Heavily overbolted, can
skip almost every other bolt. FA: Darryl Margetts 1998

PRECISION  FEATHER    21  ****  [12D]    A  super  climb!  One  of  the  better  21’s  in
Boven. The right most climb on this section of wall. Up then across a bushy face and
more climbing above. FA: Voytek Modrzewski 1998

ALMOST MY BALLS 20 ** [14D] The first line around the corner, right of Precision
Feather.  Hard and scary if you can’t reach the layback! FA. Barry Crouse.

PENNY ROYAL TEE 17 **** [14D]  A super climb, trending up and left up the slabby
face. FA: Darryl Margetts, Mark Philipps & Andrew Lynch 1996

TEEN SPIRIT  19 *** [14D]  The climb starts in the obvious crack. Climb this crack
until it is possible to move out left. Continue up the face to finish with a mantle at the top
to clip the chains.  FA: Ken Thrash, Mark Phillips, Darryl Margetts & Dave Chesney
1999. MCSA bolts.


The next 3 crags are not busy but some of the routes are as good or better than the
God No! and Superbowl. Access is easy, via the new steps at the far (right) end of
the  Superbowl.  Many  have  been  rebolted  and  there  is  scope  for  plenty  of  new
climbs, easy and hard.
The Left Wing

For some peace and quiet and some quality climbing head here. Some of the oldest
climbs at Boven..1992, still in lycra! Some of the routes that were opened on trad could
74









be  retro-bolted  to  make  this  a  more  popular  crag..just  ask  the  first  ascentionist  first!
There are some routes that will remain trad.

Climbs are described from left to right:

HEIGHT: 10 - 20 Metres

ASPECT: East facing, shady 11 am onwards.

APPROACH  (See map on page 34)

A.  From the Superbowl, walk pass all the climbs then past some wet ground, up a
bit, past a the steps that lead to the top of the cliffline (the other approach) then
the path leads down again, after 50 m or so the climbs are reached.


B.  Approach as for the right-hand end of the Superbowl, down the steep gulley by
the  lovely  new  steps,  then  keep  left  and  after  50  m  or  so  the  climbs  are
reached.

WYSIWYG  12 * [Trad] Climbs the obvious corner ramp to the left of the large stacked
roofs. Permission has been given for this route to be retrobolted as long as the opening
party & route names remain the same. FA: G Erens & R Dodding 1992

CHUNKY MONKEY  27 **** [9D] A classic. The route climbs a really obvious square
arête then rails out rightwards wildy! Low in grade. FA: Mark Seuring 1998

HOUNDS MOUSSE 25 *** [11D] Through the groove 8m right of Chunky Monkey.
FA: Axel Wachter 2000

NEW YORK CHOCOLATE FUDGE CRUNCH 18 ** [10D] This route takes the next

BALROG 25 * [9D,R] The line left of Transmogrifier. FA: Tessa Little 2001

TRANSMOGRIFIER  26 *** [9D]. A short  but fun climb. Start on the block below the
obvious  V-groove.  Name  written  at  base  of  the  climb.  Rather  easy  for  26.  FA:  Mark
Seuring 2001

UITERS TORS  21 * [Trad,R] Trad route between Transmogrifier & Endless October.
Climbs a gnarly thin seam & trends up & left. Poor gear.  FA: Stewart Middlemiss, Mike
Hislop, Clive Curson & Chris Lomax 1992.


The Theatre

A few incredible lines including some classic trad on the big obvious orange wall you
can see for miles! Be brave and leave the ‘social’ crags of God No and Superbowl for a
day and ckeck out these brilliant lines, most with shiny new bolts.

HEIGHT: 18 - 25 Metres

ASPECT: East. The corner feature puts some routes into the shade early. The left face is
East facing like most others at Wonderland.

APROACH (See map on page 34)
As for the Left Wing, continue another 50 metres or so until a huge slightly detached 4-
metre-high  block  is  reached.  The  big  orange  left-facing  wall  of  Heart  of  China  is  an
obvious landmark.

The first three climbs start off the huge block/ledge which is accessed by scrambling up
its right side. Climbs are described from left to right.

ENDLESS OCTOBER  24 **** [9D]. Starts at the left end of the ledge/block. Brilliant.
FA: Grant Murray 1992. Needs new bolts!!!!

BIKINI RED 27 ***** [9D] Stunning! I dare say..it’s better than Lotters! In the middle
of the face. Name written at base. The first bolt is very high but the climbing is super
easy. Don’t stray left at the top, just trust those feet and go! FA: Mike Hislop 1992. RB

Sparse gear. FA: Stewart Middlemiss 1991

HEART OF CHINA 23 **** [Trad, A] CLASSIC!! Up the middle of the big left facing

The Right Wing

Has anybody been back since 1992?! They will now that the path has been opeded up.
If you are looking for some hidden gems go there!

HEIGHT: 18 - 25 Metres

ASPECT : Also East facing with trees protecting the base of the wall.

APROACH: (See map on page 26). Walk on and around the corner from the Theatre.

Climbs are described from left to right:

STAR GAZERS 17 ** [Trad]  Approximately 30m right of THE THEATRE, are a pair
of open books at the top of the crag. They are 10m apart - the right hand one has a pillar
at its foot and a tree 5m up. Start below this one. Gain the ledge below the tree and then
follow the crack above to the top of the pillar below the open book. Climb this and exit

SHEAR FORCE 34 ****. Boven’s hardest line! And worthy of the crown, being long,
steep and of continually interesting climbing. Take sthe obvious 20 degree leaning wall.
Scramble up to start with a hollow flake and a hard move left to the arête. Then lots of
sidepulling  leads  to  a  desperate  campussing  crux.  BB:  Andrew  Pedley.  FA:  Kilian
Fischauber June 2014. MCSA bolts.

DAMN THE TORPEDOES 27 *** [1B,2P,N,A] Climb the ‘’Indian Creek’’ type corner

JOY DIVISION 30 **** [12D] Need a 70 m rope to get down! The rough textured
blank wall. Climb slightly rightwards with difficulty up the thin face, until you can move
back left to reach the base of the corner. Carry on to the top. Originally graded 29.
Totally impossible if you are short..go on, prove me wrong! FA: Richard Lord 1992
The Stone Philosopher Area

This crag is around the corner from The Right Wing, past JOY DIVISION. If you do
these climbs you deserve big respect for being keen and making the effort! Go do them!

TRIPLE TIER CRAGS
Map on page 83 and photo on page 84

Rarely visited these days, …but for some adventure and some mystical scenery, make
the  effort!  When  standing  on top  of  Gaper  Buttress,  one  looks  down  onto  Triple  Tier
Crags on the other side of the gorge. It’s an amazing place to climb and explore, there
are some top class routes and lots of potential, but it just requires a little effort. Some
routes  here  are  reached  by  abseiling  onto  a  stance  and  then  climbing  out.  If  you  are
staying at Tegwaan its just a 10 minute walk, out of the back of the garden.

NOTE: THE TRIPLE TIER CRAGS ARE LISTED FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AS
YOU WOULD APPROACH THEM. THE CLIMBS AT EACH CRAG ARE LEFT
TO RIGHT.
The Gym

Down by the water, some fun climbs but mostly short. Great on a hot day if you feel
like a swim; the main pool is deep and you can jump in off the rocks and picnic under
the trees on flat rock slabs. HEIGHT: 8 - 15 Metres

ASPECT: The main wall is down by the river and enjoys shade late morning onwards.
The ab-in routes face  West (afternoon sun), but the hanging stances are  mostly in the
shade.

APPROACH (map on page 83 and photo on pag 82)
If coming from town from Roc ‘n Rope. After a couple of kilometers the Elandskrans
Resort is reached on the left, before the road becomes a gravel road. If from Tranquilitas
its on the right just after the start of the tar road.

At the time of writing an NGO is operating from the resort and have made the place safe
to  park  and  climb.  The  charge  is  R20,  well  worth  it  for  the  peace  of  mind.  You  will
either find someone at reception or on the grounds. Park anywhere.

Park  Just  after  the  entrance  gate  of  Elandskrans  Resort  on  the  right,  is  a  good  path
curving down to the stream (past some stone circles), following a line of old concrete
fence posts. Stay on the main path until the stream where you will arrive at a wooden
bridge; cross here then 15 metres after the bridge take a small path on the left. This path
leads  across  some  fields  (make  sure  you    keep  left),  past  cairn  markers,  over  a  tiny
stream  through  some  bushes,  and  down  onto  a  lovely  grassy  plateau  (opposite  the
Restaurant  Crag).  There  is  an  overgown  path  leading  down  on  the  left  to  the  small
waterfall just upstream of the Gym.

Climbs are described from left to right and most are on the left side looking downstream:

ANY OBJECTIONS 19 ** [7D] Follows a crack line just left of the gulley corner on the
right of the face. FA: Fran Botha 1994

TROUBLED WATERS  20 *** [6D] This route is most easily reached by turning left at
the stream lookout where the path first comes down from the campsite. The path goes
down to a plateau next to the river. Cross the river at the lip of the first waterfall. Please
be careful - at least one person has fallen off here already. The route is up the little face
just on the other side. There are some good holds - separated by hard moves.
FA: Ruth Ferreira 1995

He-Man Area

A ‘lekker’ (very nice) Crag, really quite easy to access so long as you are competent at
abseiling and scrambling. Actually You’re a Wimp is one of the best 22s at Boven. One
of the main features of this crag is the infamous TIME BOMB BLOCK. HEIGHT: 15 -
22 Metres

ASPECT:  These  climbs  catch  some  shade  from  the blocks  and corner  features  in  the
morning.

APPROACH
As  for  The  Gym.  Gain  the  grassy  plateau  (above  the  gorge)  opposite  the  Restaurant
Crag,  follow faint paths along the cliff  edge,  for approx 300 metres. You will see the
obvious massive detached block (Time Bomb Block).




85













MAIN WALL
Pass  the  Time  Bomb  Block  and  another  detached  block  (Cat  in  the  Hat).  Another  30
metres  along  the  cliff  top  you  will  see  lots  of  lower-offs  and  chains.  Abseil  from  very
visible abseil point above INCIDENTALLY I'M MACHO.

Climbs are described from left to right:

COTAPAXI  19 * [Trad] Climbs the wall 10 - 20m left of IIM. This route climbs a thin

Boven. FA: Grant Murray 1991

ACTUALLY  YOU'RE  A  WIMP  22  *****  [10D]  Start  with  2  bolts  as  for  IIM.  Fire
straight up the wall on u-bolts to lower-offs.  FA: Clive Curson 1994
IT  22 *** [8D] Clip 3 bolts on AYAW. Trend right into a break and up.  FA: Mike

SUPER EGO 23 *** [9D] The arete. FA: Grant Murray 1993

THE CAT IN THE HAT 27 ** [Trad, 2B] Approach by scrambling down the chimney
behind the 2nd apartment-sized hanging block. Climb the overhanging rock in the small
theatre, past two bolts, exiting up the left hand crack.  FA: Richard Lord 1991

THE TIME BOMB BLOCK
The next climbs are on the Time Bomb Block. Hop across onto it. Abseil off bolts at the
top, to a decent slopey ledge 15 m down. Climbs are described from left to right:

SHADOW  MAN  27  ****  [8D]  Climb  the  sequential  left  hand  edge  from  a  hanging
stance to a single bolt. Can be dusty. FA: Mike Cartwright 1992

MIND  GAMES (OPEN) PROJECT Starts just right of  shadow  man. This is a project
bolted  by  Alex  Bester  and  Wesley  Black.  If  you  are  keen  to  try  it,  contact  Alex  or
Wesley. Probably well into the thirties and an amazing line. BB Alex Bester and Wesley
Black Oct 2010. MCSA bolts.

TOO EARLY FOR THE SKY [ GPS: S25 39 10.4 E30 20 56.0] 18 ** [10D]
Rap down 200m along from the ab-in routes at the gym. Some top bolts are found 25m
before  reaching  the  Time  Bomb  Block.  Use  the  chains  to  ab  to  a  stance  slightly  left.
Enjoy the view. A fine rap-bolting affair. FA: Mike Cartwright & Fran Botha 1992

TOO LATE FOR THE STARS   8 **** [9B] A perfect route to see if you like heights or
not. Start 10m right of TEFTS.  FA: Nerine Richards 2002





86


THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH [ GPS: S25 39 10.3 E30 20 55.5] 21 ** [13B] Ab in
15 right of TLFTS. Be aware that you need to pendulum to the left to reach the stance,
keep a sling or quick draw handy. FA: Sean Ferguson 2002


SKELETOR SECTION
These new routes are located about 40m East of the main wall. Facing Cotapaxi, walk left
past a corner and a wide crack, down a few meters to a narrow ledge. There are two cracks
are about 2m apart and just left of a short corner.

SKELETOR 21 **** [Trad] Climb the steep hand/fist crack on the left. Over the small
roof the angle eases. Belay from blocks at the top of the cliff. FA: Richard Halsey, April
2012.

SHE-RA 20 ** [Trad] Climb the right-hand crack with a tricky start into a small offwidth.
At the aloe traverse left to finish up Skeletor. FA: Richard Halsey, April 2012.

The Foundry

Some  of  the  steepest  climbing  at  Boven  is  found  here,  including  one  of  the  most
memorable 22s around. In an elecrical storm, hide in the back of the deepest section of
the caves. HEIGHT: 10 - 25 Metres. ASPECT: North! It is not called the Foundry for
nothing, it can bake here even in winter. Best visited on a very cold day, or a cloudy or
even drizzly day (as it’s steep). Walk carefully around the base. A fall onto the next tier
could hurt a lot.

APPROACH
As for He Man Area, then follow the path along the edge of the plateau. The path climbs
up slightly until a ridge of large boulders is reached (cairn). The rap chains are on flat
white rock on the cliff edge. You are now on top of MELTDOWN and from here you
can see Jump In The Fire, the obvious steep route! Make sure everybody in your party
can  manage  some  easy  climbing  out.  Climb  out  on  Smelt  Down  (tough  after  a  day’s
climbing) or scramble out further right around the corner (grade 12- ish.).

Climbs are described from left to right starting with those at the far left past the cave:

DANCES WITH WOMBATS 24 *** [11D] Start 5m below and just to the left of VOL
LIBRE. This somewhat runout route shares the last bolt and chains of VL. Please note
this  route  is  28m  long.  Do  not  screw  up  your  approach.  FA:  Stephan  Isebeck  1994

VOL LIBRE 21 **** [12D] Awesome face climbing off the extreme left hand edge of
the small subsidiary ledge. Translation: "Free falling." Belay off cold shuts and top out if
you want. FA: John Orrock 1994

DANSE DE LA PLUIE  20 **** [13D] "Rain dance" shoots up right of VL on u-bolts
with a tricky start.  FA: Jayson Orton & Ross Suter 2000

At the main cave, a tricky scramble down to the lower tier will take you to the next two
routes

MR JIVE 17 * [5D] On the arete on the lower buttress. FA: Glenn Harrison & Jacques
Holland 1994

DR HECKYL  18 * [5D] Shares bolt 1 and chains with Mr Jive. Stay out of the corner.
FA: Jacques Holland & Glenn Harrison 1994

The following climbs are just to the right of the caves.

KEEP THE FAITH  25 *** [9D] Starts up a steep corner at the left edge of the main
ledge area. Mega pump with crux at last move.   FA: Günther Migeotte 1994

MERCURY REV  27 **** [10D] Wild pump up mega steep rock just to the right of
KEEP THE FAITH's corner. Can be dusty if not climbed recently. FA: Tim Hoole 1994

THE  SURGE  26  ***  [10D]  The  line  right  of  MR.  FA:  Gilles  Benier  1997  (BB)  Ian
Guest

SMELT 24  *** [10D] Great route with a "go-for-it" crux, about 10m left of the right
hand edge of this wall. FA: Ian Guest 1994

ZOOZANIA 24 **** [12D] Climbs the diagonal to the left of JITF. Take 4 long quick
draws for the roof going diagonally up right. A.k.a. “Snake.” FA: Doug Ward 1994

JUMP IN THE FIRE  22 **** [10D] A wild route on monster holds. Starts at the right
hand edge of the main face; then rails out ahorizonyally along the side of the roof. The
climb is clearly visible from the top of the crag. FA: John Orrock 1994

COAL MAN 20 ** [8D] Starts about 7m south of the rock platform. Climb the slanting
crack  to  the  right  and  pull  the  roof  to  chains. FA:  Glenn  Harrison  1995  (BB)  Steve
Coleman


COKE  STOKER  21  ***  [6D]  The  next  4  routes  are  on  the  east  face  of  the  Rock
Platform. This route starts about 4m from the prominent dihedral. FA: John Orrock 1995


SMOULDER  18 *** [6D] Fun route - also very reachy. 6m left of the corner. FA: John
Orrock 1994

SMELTDOWN 17 *** [6D] Starts in a corner about 8m right of a large dihedral. Pull
left after a few metres, then up SMOULDER to the chains. This bypasses the obvious
fierce reach  move. Can be used to climb out from the crag at the end of the day. FA:
John Orrock 1994




















88











MELTDOWN [ GPS: S25 39 10.5 E30 21 03.0]  20 *** [6D] Starts in SMELTDOWN'S
corner. Move up then right towards the skyline arete;  yard up on growing incuts. FA:
John Orrock 1994

BEAUTY  20 * [Trad]  Feel like an adventure? Walk left from the abseil point along the
ledge to where it ends below an open recess and to the right of a prominent nose 8m up.
This point is about 10m above the base of the cliff and 15m to the right of the prominent
recess, marked with bird-lime, cutting through the entire height of the cliff. Climb steeply
up the corner to where it is possible to move diagonally up left onto the massive blocks on
the right-hand side of the nose. Step left and up onto the face above. Move diagonally left
onto a ledge. Belay on the left. Make a strenuous take-off from the right hand side of the
ledge and continue awkardly up the left slanting crack to where it is possible to step left to
a small ledge. Climb up and then move diagonally back right on good hand holds across
an exposed face to a line of flakes sloping up left. Climb to the top of this and continue up
the steep face above to the top. FA: Paul Fatti & Mike Scott 1992

CORNEY 15 * [Trad] The upper part of the climb follows the prominent, clean, right-
facing corner about 20m left of the abseil point. Start just right of the prominent overhangs
10m up and climb the crack leading into a left facing corner, which goes through a steep,
glossy face to a sloping ledge below the upper corner. Continue up the corner to the top.
FA: Mike Scott & Paul Fatti 1992

ABROUTE 17 * [Trad] Nowdays people usually rap in using the chains of SMOULDER
or  SMELTDOWN.  This  route  follows  the  abseil  line  up  to  the  abseil  tree  (large
stamvrug). Start up the right leaning crack and climb it via a tricky layback move before
stepping  left  to  a  resting  point  below  the  small  overhang.  Climb  straight  up  through  the
overhang to the tree. FA: Paul Fatti & Mike Scott 1992

OFFROUTE  13  *  [Trad]  Start  up  ABROUTE  and  then  climb  the  recess  on  the  right.
FA: Mike Cartwright 1993

REFERENDUM 17 ** [Trad] Abseil off the big stamvrug and then walk back 40m along
the ledge towards The Restaurant. In a corner is a steep, right leaning layback crack. To
the left of the corner are two very steep jam cracks, either side of a huge block. Climb the
corner  crack  to  the  ledge  -  escape  up  and  leftwards.  This  line  joins  the  now  bolted
SMELTDOWN. FA: Gordon Erens & Russ Dodding 1992

SHIFTING THE GOALPOSTS  17 ** [Trad] Starts below the 15cm wide corner-crack
to the right of the abseil tree. Climb the corner crack for 2m, traverse right across the slab
and  then  gain  the  ledge  up  to  the  right.  Ascend  the  delightful  wall  above,  trending
diagonally right to the blocky ledge. FA: Russ Dodding & Gordon Erens 1992
The Acid House

Enough hard and steep climbs to get you high! Could spend a full day doing classic 23’s
to 25’s. HEIGHT: 18 - 28 Metres. ASPECT : North facing, this crag also does not have
much  shade  at  the base,  except for  summer  mornings  when  the big  corner on  the  left







89











casts a shadow over the crag. Wasps also love these faces - do not get put off by this for
the climbing is great.

APPROACH
Approach as for the He Man area and past the Foundry another 100 metres or so. Abseil
in from chains placed in an open book with a sandy stance on top of Cucumber Zoo, or
walk along the base from the Far Side.

Climbs are described from left to right:

CUCUMBER ZOO  19 *** [11D] Climb the cool corner. Harder for midgets. Use this
route to ab in. FA: Doug Ward 1994

NINE INCH NAILS  24 **** [9D] Climb just right of the big roof and corner on the left
of the  wall.  The route takes three overlaps  en route to the top. FA:  Günther Migeotte
1994

CUT ME SOME SLACK  23 **** [9D] The line just to the right of NIN. FA: Stephan
Isebeck 1994

NAILING JELLY TO THE CEILING 25 *** [10D]  This shares the first and last bolt
with the previous route. Prepare for some extended reaches, especially if you don't bump
your head in most doorways. FA: Stephan Isebeck 1994

HALFWAY HOUSE  19 *** [8D] Rap down 5m right of the previous routes, some 15m
from the big corner, to a belay above the roof or aid up to the stance using the 3 bolts
under the overlap. FA: Stephan Isebeck 1994

FUNKY ACID TRIP 27 *** [9D] Around the arete and corner - it starts about 5m from
the corner. FA: Doug Ward 1995

ACID ON THE BRAIN  25 *** [11D] Starting about 8m from the corner, climb past 5
bolts.  After  the  roof  move  slightly  left,  and  head  for  the  top.  FA:  Doug  Ward  1994

MISTER  EXCELLENT  24  ****  [9D]  Starts  left  of  the  corner  arête.  The  route  is
probably a grade easier for tall persons and harder for midgets.  FA: Doug Ward 1994

GERMAN CANNIBAL 28 *** (11D) The obvious arête at the far right hand end of the
crag, probably very good. FA: Jens Richter.

The Far Side

Not  many  routes  here  but  there  is  potential  to  find  and  open  some  new  climbs.
HEIGHT: 18 Metres. ASPECT : Faces North. Perfect in  winter or on a very  cloudy
day.

APPROACH







90

As for the Foundry, keep walking along the cliff top. A huge block can be seen hanging
over a steep clean face past the overhanging crags of the Foundry and Acid House. The
route NEW AGE is situated on this face. One can abseil in from anchors on the block or
walk about 15m past to a scramble path to reach the base. The trail walks back to the
base of the crag and eventually reaches the Acid house 130m along.


NEW AGE [ GPS: S25 39 12.6 E30 21 11.0] 25 **** [8D] Start up the corner crack for
6m, then head up the wall.  FA: Clive Curson 1996 (BB) John Orrock 1994

JOYRIDE   18 *** [8D] Climb the previous crack to the top of the pillar. Step right to a
good crack. Climb this to lower offs.  FA: John Orrock 1994

THE RESTAURANT CRAGS

If you visit one crag at the Restaurant Crags make it the Restaurant Crag itself!
This  was  the  first  area  to  be  developed  at  Boven,  back  in  the  early  nineties,  and  still
hosts some of the highest quality climbing in Boven, up to 29. The crags are situated
around the Elandskrans Resort, now closed for camping but is safe to park at now that an
NGO is operating from there.
The School

A small crag, perhaps good for a warm up before going on to Restaurant or Triple Tier.
HEIGHT: 15 Metres ASPECT : South East. Shady by late morning.

APPROACH (map on page 83 and photo on page 84)
As  for  The  Restaurant  Crag  (below).    Either  walk  in  from  the  base  of  the  Restaurant
Crag, or park just before the conference hall, there is a poor path leading down into the
valley over a small  wall. This path leads steeply down the hillside to the river. About
50m down you will see a small path on the left,  heading slightly upwards till you find
the first routes after 40m or so.

Climbs are described from left to right:

THE  GALLERY    20  ***  [9D]  Steep  start  to  a  great  face/corner.  Stiff  take-off.  FA:
Lizette Guest 1993

I GUEST NOT  25 *** [10D] Steep powerful arete just right of THE GALLERY. FA:
Tim Hoole 1993 (BB) Ian Guest

FIRST ASSIGNMENT  16 *** [9D] Classic at its grade. A vertical wall facing north.
FA: Lizette Guest 1993
The Restaurant Crag

This crag did not make the  front cover of  Rotpunkt for nothing, one of Boven’s best.
The clean leaning orange faces host some incredible routes, especially in the 20’s. Jambo
and  Bonar  to  name  just  a  couple.  HEIGHT:  18  -  28  Metres  ASPECT  :  Southeast.
Shady by late morning. This crag is often dry when other crags are wet, it dries almost
instantly and is gently overhanging.

APPROACH (map on page 83 and photo on page 84)
If coming from town from Roc ‘n Rope. After a couple of kilometers the Elandskrans
Resort is reached on the left, before the road becomes a gravel road. If from Tranquilitas
its on the right just after the start of the tar road.

At the time of writing an youth development NGO is operating from the resort and have
made the place safe to park and climb. The charge is R20, well worth it for the peace of
mind. You will either find someone at reception or on the grounds. Park anywhere.







92








Park  anywhere  out  of  the  way.  Don’t  leave  valuables  in  the  car.  On  foot,  pass  the
swimming pools, heading right towards the cliffs past a warning sign (steep cliffs etc.).
Before reaching the viewpoint at the top of the Gaper buttress, turn sharp right and after
20  metres  the  path  forks,  go  left  and  down  steeply  through  trees  over  some  slippery
rocks. If you go down immediately beside (on right looking out) of the Gaper Butress
viewpoint you will end up in a gully that is the access for Gaper itself.

Climbs are described from left to right:

two..FA: Mike Behr 1997

MOSTLY  HARMLESS  27  ***  [8D]  Solid  at  the  grade.  Starts  just  to  the  right  of  a
smooth wall and few metres left of a huge chossy crack. FA: Mike Cartwright 1993.

A  fun  little  crag.  A  bit  short  but  one  or  two  nice  lines.  HEIGHT:  10  -  15  Metres.
ASPECT  :  Monsoon  Wall  faces  East  with  some  of  the  routes  situated  on  the  south-

THE ISLAND CRAGS

The  distinctive  ‘island’  of  rock  above  the  highway;  the  locals  refer  to  this  outcrop  as
‘Loskop’, literally  meaning loose (standing) head; try to keep  yours screwed on.  The
climbing  is  vertical  to  gently  leaning  and  technical;  for  some  5-star  technical  face
climbing this is the place to visit, especially for 18 to 26. The Beach has a collection
of 21-25’s that beat anything at the Wonderland!  These days  these crags don’t see
much traffic and the forest is taking back the crags; don’t let this put you off though,
have a retro day and tick a load of old classics.

APPROACH (map on page 83)
As  per  the  Restauarnt  Crags.  Walk  past  the  swimming  pools.  At  the  corner  of  the
basketball court a good path leads out over the grassy plateau. If you can’t find the path
just walk through the grass in the direction of the hill in the distance with the fire-break
running down it. After 5 mins you will get a point where you can see the Island. By the
large cairn (pile of stones) go steeply down (no path) into the little valley, into the trees
(watch-out for holes!), then up the other side on a path that leads up past some more big
cairns to the top of the Island.

The Boulevard

Not  the  main  event  but the  quality  shortish  climbs  are  a  great  for  a  warm  up  for  The
Beach.  HEIGHT:  15  -  18  Metres.  ASPECT  :  North  facing.  Bake  nicely  here  in  the
winter sun or get up early in summer.

APPROACH (map on page 83)
As  for  The  Gulley,  go  down  the  gulley  50  m,  past  (on  your  L)  the  climb  Return  to
Wogan Valley and Allegro Non Troppo, turn right around a boulder after a few seconds
you will see the cliffs up the hill, path is basically non-existent so just thrash through.

Climbs are described from left to right:

obvious recess. 3m from the righthand edge of the buttress. FA: Clive Curson 1994






The Gulley

A shady gulley with some nice technical slab and face climbs. The Beach is only a few
metres away; combined these are the best crags at the Island. HEGHT: 15 - 25 Metres.
ASPECT: Although it faces northeast the opposite walls and the trees create a  coolness.
Best to climb here on a cool day though or late in the afternoon.

APPROACH (map on page 83)
From the cairns as you arrive onto the Island, walk 50 metres across the ‘summit’ and
you can’t fail to see the obvious wide gulley. Scramble down leftwards easily.

Only a few metres from the Gulley. This crag hosts a collection of 21-25’s that beat
most at the Wonderland - get in shape and come onsight them all, in one day!

SHRINE OF THE SEA MONKEYS  24 ***** [9D] Just maybe the best 25 in Boven?!

Very spaced bolts but safe. Maybe not the best choice unless you are comfortable on 24!
FA: Tim Hoole 1993. New anchors 2010 ish.

CASTAWAY 24 **** [9D] Starts up the arete on the right. Fingery face to a great rest

sagging in your harness! Quite a stretch to clip the crux bolt. The name is written on the
rock. FA: Grant Murray 1993

Never-never Land

What a weird but cool place, a collection of pinnacles and chasms, you have to climb
here at least once. HEIGHT: 10 - 15 Metres. ASPECT: All directions! You will find
sun, shade or half-half. The chasms are cool on a hot day.

APPROACH (map on page 83)

As you arrive at the top of the Island, head northwest for 100 metres until you reach the
corner  overlooking  the  highway;  you  will  see  some  deep  dark  chasms  and  pillars.
Standing above the chasms, facing out, on the left is an open bushy gulley. Walk down
this easily. Halfway down on the right is a nice ledge (Shiver Me Timbers etc are here).
To get to the rest of the climbs, continue down the gulley and across a rocky slope, on
the  right  you  will  see  an  obvious  cleft/chasm  with  a  huge  chockstone.  Walk  up  this
chasm and you will arrive facing Guys Slab.

The first three climbs start off a nice flat ledge halfway down the descent gully on the
right.

SHIVER  ME  TIMBERS    18  ***  [7D]  Starts  off  the  left  hand  edge  of  a  wide  ledge

SPORT VALLEY CRAGS

APPROACH (map on page 83)

Sport  Valley  is  the  little  valley  on  your  left  when  you  approach  the  main  gate  of  the
Elandskrans  Mountain  Resort.  Some  of  the  climbs  here  are  of  top  quality,  some  real
gems. The Coven has a handful of 5-star classics and Flying Is Fun is possibly the best
crag at Boven for very easy routes (8 to 12).

Note that the Sport Valley crags have been the site of a small
number  muggings  over  the  years...  Go  in  a  large  group  and
leave your expensive clothing, wallets and phones at home.


The Pasture

Some  pleasant  but  very  short  climbs.  HEIGHT  8  -  10  Metres.  ASPECT:  This  crag
faces east. It enjoys the morning sun.

APPROACH (map on page 83)

A.  Drive into Elandskrans Resort, as per the Restauarant Crags

Park somewhere by the old chalets. Past the cellphone tower there an old put-
put (crazy golf) course. Find a trail leading down gently into the valley, you
will see the small crags of the pasture facing you. Cross over the stream and up
to the base of the crag. There is now also a trail between the Pasture and the
Coven and Flying is Fun


B.  Park INSIDE the ACRA retreat,– call to check 013 257 7088. The owners will
welcome  you.  Be  sure  to  return  the  favour  and  have  a  beer  on  the  deck
afterwards, its stunning.. From the house, walk towards Elandskrans Resort for
120 metres, down and then left to the base of the crags.

problem on the far right of the crag. FA: Mike Behr 1994
The Coven

When the climbers first arrived at the Coven, the candles and grafitti made them wonder
what sort of ceremonies  were  conducted here. Probably just a Zionist clan… anyway,
this crag hosts a few amazing technical climbs. This crag used to be one of the busiest
around but thanks to a small number of muggings over the years it is understandably les
popular. Go in a large group and take no valuables and ideally with a local, best speak to
Roc n’ Rope for advice.

HEIGHT:  15  -  25  Metres. ASPECT:  East  facing  with  some  routes  facing  southeast,
shady late morning onwards In winter this crag is pretty warm and sheltered. There is
lots of shade at the base of most routes.

A.  Park INSIDE the ACRA retreat – call to check 013 257 7088. The owners will
welcome  you.  Be  sure  to  return  the  favour  and  have  a  beer  on  the  deck
afterwards,  its  stunning.  From  the  house  walk  down  the  hill  a  little  then
diagonally  down  left  along  the  cliff  top.    Cross  over  a  small  stream  before
finding an obvious gulley. Scramble down here and follow a trail keeping left
and along the base of the crag.

HEIGHT: 15 - 20 Metres. ASPECT : Faces East with shade at the base of some routes.

APPROACH: (map on page 83)
Continue along to the path at the base of the Coven. After about 50 m along over some
blocks these towers lie with fun moderate climbing.

BOLTS  FROM  HELL  18  ***  [10D,R]  45m  along  from  the  last  routes  of  the  Coven.

Flying Is Fun

This  crag  offers  fantastic  sustained  easy  and  moderate  climbs.  Probably  the  best
beginner  crag  in  Bioven. Has  been  the  site  of  a  small  number  of   muggings  over  the
years being so close to the town. Go in a large group and take no valuables and ideally
with a local, best speak to Roc n’ Rope for advice.

HEIGHT:  8  -  15  Metres.  ASPECT:  This  crag  face  northwest,  making  it  cool  in  the
mornings and getting some sun from midday onwards.

APPROACH: (map on page 83)
Park inside the Elandskrans Resort as described for The Restaurant Crag (p 89). A path
leaves the Resort just by the corner of the basketball court (past the swimming pools).
Walk along the trail over open rocky grassland heading in the direction of the township
until you arrive at the cliff edge (from where the Coven can be seen on the other side of
the valley).  Go down and right about 10 metres  and there is a scramble down. If  you
have dogs or non-climbing friends there is a less defined but easier path about 70m to the
left when you arrive at the cliff edge.

Climbs are described from left to right:

UP IN ARMS 20 **** [11D]
The  only  climb  left  (when  facing  the  crag)  of  the  normal descent  gulley.  From  gully,
continue down into the valley for 20m. Turn right around a block and steeply up past a
large loose laying flat boulder. The line is obvious. Step over a large crack in the ground
to clip the first bolt just left of a blocky buttress. The climb snakes right halfway up with
a reachy crux. FA: Glenn Harrison & Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2005

The rest of the climbs are to the right of the descent gulley:

VISIONS  OF  COSMIC  DOOM      9  ****  [7D]  The  arete  at  the  bottom  of  the  access
gulley. A classic! FA: Clive Curson 1991

TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE  12 *** [8D] Takes in the hand crack 4m right of
the VOCD. Uses the lower offs to the left or right.  FA: Clive Curson 1991

MRI 11 ** [8D] The wide crack just right of TCM. FA: Clive Curson 1991

FLY  FOR  LIFE  13  ***  [7D]  The  recess  just  right.  Shares  3  bolts  with  MRI.  Can  be
awkward going right past the roof without technique. Trend back left to lower-off. FA:
Clive Curson 1991

DWARF TOSSING  22 *** [7D] The slab just right of the arete. Head for the arete after
the 4th bolt. Going straight up the face is trickier. FA: Clive Curson 1992

RIP  21 *** [8D] The prominent crackline, using the tree or traversing in under the roof
to start.  FA: Clive Curson 1991

RIP DIRECT 23 **** [8D] Direct start is 23/24 - height dependent. FA: Clive Curson
1993

MIDNIGHT MISSION 18 **** [9D] The seam 2m right of RIP, using anything. Climb
only the seam for a somewhat more specific exercise. FA: Clive Curson 1991

FLOATING  ON  THE  STORM  16  **  [9D]  Crackline  just  right of  MM.  Fine  line but
there is a great temptation to step right onto THERMAL'S block at the crux. Probably 18
if you're short. FA: Clive Curson 1992














111











THERMAL 11 *** [9D] The easiest break in this area. Up the corner to a recess, using 5
bolts  on  FOTS.  Step  back  left  to  FOTS  lower-offs  after  surmounting  the  block.  FA:
Clive Curson 1991

BLOOD IN THE DUST 13 ** [9D] Starts in the recess just right of THERMAL/FOTS.
Pull through to a ledge. Continue up the recess and arete above. Go out right to STONE
COLD'S finish. FA: Clive Curson 1991

STONE COLD 15 ** [9D] Takes the slanting crack just right of BITD. Continue up the
arete and out right to the loweroffs at the high point. FA: Clive Curson 1991

GREATEST DOCTOR IN THE UNIVERSE 21 *** [9D] Start up FROZEN FLESH'S
crack. Move up left to climb the face just right of the arete. Finish at the same lower-offs
as STONE COLD. FA: Clive Curson & Barbara Marcus 1992

FROZEN FLESH 24 **** [8D] Follows the crackline right of the arete into a shallow
corner. Climb the face straight above.  FA: Clive Curson 1991

DOA 19 *** [8D] The fierce-looking handcrack. Harder for midgets. FA: Clive Curson
1992

BLOOD TRANSFUSION 20 *** [9D] Start up DYING TO FLY. Move 2m left at half
height to a vague seam. Climb this.  FA: Clive Curson 1992

DYING TO FLY 20 *** [8D] The first right leaning crack off the ledge, about 6m right
of DOA. A bouldery move to gain the slab. FA: Clive Curson & Grant Murray 1991

THREE BLIND MICE 20 *** [8D] The other right leaning crack - more technical but
easier than DTF. Step right from the ledge - the first 5m are off-balance. Probably 19 if
you work out the moves quickly.  FA: Clive Curson & Grant Murray 1991

SEE HOW THEY RUN 21 *** [9D] This is the direct start to THREE BLIND MICE,
follow the crack from ground level.  FA: Clive Curson 1992

THE  CARVING  KNIFE    20  ***  [9D]  From  the  base  of  the  THREE  BLIND  MICE
crack,  move  diagonally  right  on  the  face  to  the  3rd  bolt.  Climb  straight  up,  joining
THREE BLIND MICE to the top. FA: Clive Curson 1995

HIGH NOON  21 **** [7D] 4m right of the ledge edge. A bit reachy. There is a lot of
climbing around the 4th bolt.  FA: Clive Curson 1992

BOLTED BONES  17 **** [6D] The beautiful fingercrack 4m left of the corner. Start
off a little ledge. FA: Clive Curson 1991

PROBLEM is another block. Climb the crack.  FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2001

PIETER STYWE SERSANT 12 *** [5D] The face right of the crack in the middle of
the boulder.  FA: Johan Olivier & Deon Vermeulen 2003

There are some more easy climbs (12 to 15?) on the left side of the large boulder on
which Les Trois Meufs is found. If the first acentionist wants to name and grade them,
please post the updates on Wiki climb.

The Other Side

HEIGHT: 15 - 25 Metres. ASPECT: This crag faces East, North and West. This means
you can just move along to escape the heat or stay out of the chimneys in winter. The
bases of most routes here are not as flat and open as you might have seen on other crags.

APPROACH (map on page 83)



113





Approach  as  per  Flying  is  Fun.  100  metres  before  the  cliff  top,  large  cairns  (piles  of
stones) are obvious on the right of the path. Follow a faint trail leading diagonally down
right for 60 metres, into a shallow tree-filled easy gully. Go down a bit then keep left
until you arrive at the obvious huge dark detached pillar where Yuduvudu is located.

It might be tempting to stroll along from Flying is Fun along the base, but this trail is
quite loose and dangerous in places. Rather go up to the top and across.

Climbs are described from left to right:

SPOOKS IN THE CLOSET 19 ** [7D] Goes up the orange-grey slab 5 metres left of
the detached pillar.  FA: Antoinette Lessing 1994 (BB) Charl du Toit

URIEL'S MACHINE 13 ** [9D] The gap between the obvious deteched pillar and the
main wall is a wide chimney. Two thirds up the chimney is a large chockstone. Layback
up  a  zig-zag  crack  directly  beneath  the  chockstone.  Variation:  Climb  the  route  as  a
chimney - somewhat easier. FA: E van der Poel & H Steinmann 2001

TOILET BRUSH 12 ** [8D] Two meters to the right of  URIEL'S MACHINE. Starts
directly beneath a small overhang five meters up.  Note: A toilet brush was used to clean
both UM and TB and its name is no reflection on how one climbs the route. FA: E van
der Poel & H Steinmann 2001

YUDUVUDU  25  ****  [8D]  Near  the  base  of  the  descent  gulley  on  the  right  is  an
obvious detached pillar. This route takes the leaning dark face. FA: Glenn Harrison 1994

WEIGH-LESS CRACK 14 ** [7D] On the northern side of the pinnacle is a large crack;
if you are thin enough climb it! FA: Etienne van der Poel & Hildegard Steinmann Dec
2001

There are 4 climbs between Weigh-less Crack and Blokkies Joubert, but only record of
two. If you know anything more, please post an update on Wiki climb.

UNAMED CLIMB. 4 metres right of Frequent Flyer, passes a small overlap at about 6
metres height then up the slab all the way.

FREQUENT FLYER  17 *** [9D] 6m right of WEIGH-LESS CRACK is a line going

der Poel & Hildegard Steinmann Dec 2001

2ND ANNIVERSARY 15 ** [7D] 2m right of Tea for Two starting just to the left of the
flaring chimney.  FA: Etienne van der Poel & Hildegard Steinmann Dec 2001

I DRINK THEREFORE I AM. 15** [8D] Start as for 2nd Anniversary but move onto the
steep  column  to  the  right,  finishing  just  left  of  the  overhang.  FA:  Stephanie  Mallory

facing yellow-grey slab. The climb starts off a big block. FA: Cara Fleischer April 2004.

Not sure which of the next two climbs are first..

ANY OTHER F@CKERS 15 [N] A good trad line that should remain unbolted. Climbs
the obvious crack system 5m lower and to the right of Nearly Headless Nick. FA: Stephen
Mallory, Dean Gurney, Cara Fleisher, Stephanie Mallory, Richard Mallory 2004

CURSE OF THE ARMADILLO  14 *** [Trad] A few metres right of Nearly Headless
Nick. Climb the cracks up the slab and exit left. FA: Gary Lotter 1991

The next climbs start 40 metres further along, past a very intimidating steep blank bowl
of rock with a flaky red wall on its right side.

OF HERBS AND STEWED RABBIT 22 ** [Trad,2B] Up the right arête of the flaky
red wall, starting in a large crack left of the arête.. It needs a lot of gear, has some hollow
rock and is included in this guide mainly because of the name! FA: Gary Lotter 1991

MIXER MINCER SHREDDER LIQUIDIZER 27 *** [8D The bolt line up a prominent
steep slab a few  metres right of  the aforementioned bowl. Starts off  a big ledge. May

THE WATERFALL CRAGS
(Map on page 117)

You  have  to  climb  here  atleast  once  or  you  havn’t  fully  experienced  Boven.
Waterval  Boven  means  ‘above  the  waterfall’  in  Dutch  .…and  the  waterfall  is  pretty
damn impressive! To look at it from the tourist view-point is great, but to climb on the
crags beside it is much more exhilarating! There are a number of crags in this area, with
a stack of classic ‘atmospheric’ sport and trad pitches. Make the effort to climb here at
least once on your trip, a day down at the Waterfall crags is always memorable, mostly
for the right reasons!

The A.C.R.A. Wall

Images of ACRA wall have probably sold the idea of climbing in South Africa to more
climbers than any other single face in the country. Pictures of the wall have appeared in
most of the famous climbing magazines in the world, as well as on book covers, posters
and  almanacs.  The  climbing  is  long,  sustained,  with  awesome  views  in  an  exposed
location.

HEIGHT: 20 - 30 Metres ASPECT: Southeast facing, getting some rays of sun in the
mornings during summer months.

APPROACH
Ask if you can be dropped off here by the friendly staff at Roc 'n Rope Adventures or
one of the local climbers. Then walk back home afterwards, it’s a good experience to
walk up through the township. From Roc & Rope, drive downhill towards the railway.
At the T-junction turn right and go down the hill into the township (Emgwenya), turn left
at the T-juntion. Just before reaching the waterworks, about 650m along, turn left down
(the  second)  steep  passable  dirt road.  This  takes  one  over  a  low-level  concrete  bridge
over  the  river,  then  turn  right  and  right  again  after  100  metres  at  a  fork.  Continue
underneath the main N4 highway. The parking place is the dead end just above the the
Elands Falls. The abseil points are not more than 30 metres from this point.

Do not leave any bags or valuables in the car, locked vehicles have been broken into
here. It is better to be dropped off then walk back.

To access the A.C.R.A wall, walk towards the cliff top and find the correct abseil point.
The abseil for climbs between Sorcery and You Too Brutus is about 20 m left in a small
chimney at the top of the crag. This abseil takes you to some stepped ledges about 15
metres above the forest floor.  Hang the draws on your route and chalk up a few holds on
the way down. You can scramble along these ledges easily to get to the base of each of
the climbs. Do not leave any bags at the top of the crag.

ground  from  the  ledge  and  scramble  upslope  to  the  base  of  the  long  (WB)  gulley,
scramble out here (grade 10, there are chains at top if required)



Climbs are described from left to right:

URISK  THE  RUSTIC  BROWNIE  23  ***  [11D]  An  incredible  position,  beside  the
waterfall.  This  is  the  first  line  to  the  right  when  looking  at  the  waterfall.  Abseil  to  a
bolted stance 20m down and climb back out. A 60m rope is needed to escape from the
stance if you do get stuck. FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2000 (BB Alan Jarvis)

BEFORE  THE  INNER  CHILD  24  ***  [Trad]  The  face  left  of  the  arete.  FA:  Peter
Lazarus & Tessa Little 2002

SORCERY  25 **** [Trad,R,X,A] Awesome line - famous for the photo opportunity with
the  waterfall  in  the  background.  Starting  just  left  of  the  arete,  climb  it.  Take  care,
protection is sparse!   FA: Mike Cartwright 1991

SATAN'S  TEMPLE  31  *****  [14D]  Starts  just  right  of  the  arete  from  a  great  ledge.
Involves a long dyno and a very fingery headwall. An awesome climb in an awesome
place. FA: Stefan Glowacz 1995 (BB Grant Murray)

UNLIMITED POWER 28  ****  [10D] Starts from the  chains on the left of the ledge.
Power moves take you steeply left and up the headwall.  Was opened at 27. FA: Grant
Murray 1991

SCREAMING BLUE MESSIAH  26 **** [Trad,A] Trad line - no bolts. From the chains
at the left edge of the ledge, head slightly right into the obvious break. Keep going. FA:
Gary Lotter 1991

SOMETHING ESOTERIC  23 **** [9D] The next crack right of SBM, about 4m right
of  the  first  corner.  Quite  runout but  wonderful.  Zap  up  to  the  chains.  It is  possible  to
access by rapping in from the tree on top.  FA: Gary Lotter 1991 on trad.

JITTERBUG PERFUME  25 *** [Trad, 2B, A] The corner. The 2 existing bolts are not
well placed (this & the last 2 routes will hopefully be retrobolted one day soon). Top out
just right of the crack. FA: Gary Lotter 1991

through the overlaps to the chains. RB in 2008. FA: Grant Murray 1992

WB Wall

Can you guess what WB stands for!? An eerie crag, with the wind howling through the
gap. Boer Skiet.. is probably the most exposed 17 in Boven, great fun at the end of a day.

HEIGHT: 15 Metres ASPECT: Same as for ACRA Wall, cold in winter. Tie into the
rap chains to belay on these two routes. Take a plastic bag and an an old cloth to wipe
baboon droppings etc. often found at the stance.

APPROACH (Map on page 117):  Park as for ACRA Wall. From the parking, walk
back along the dirt road until a small trail after about 20m leads down to the railway.
Follow the railway track to the mouth of the train tunnel. The WB Gulley is now on your
right. Scramble 5 m down the gulley to belay chains with the routes on your left.

LOST  TRACK    21  *  [6D]    From  the  WB  graffiti,  climb  the  left  hand line  to  chains.
Apart from the photo potential, this route is not as good as it looks. FA:Grant Murray,
Ian Manson 1992

BOER SKIET DIEF DOOD  17 *** [8D] Clip the first bolt on LT, then traverse up to
the  right  hand  line.  Translation  :  “Farmer  shoots  thief  dead.”  This  was  a  newspaper
headline that day! FA: Ian Manson, Grant Murray 1992

The Last Crag of the Century

Routes  here  are  up  to  35  metres  long  and  the  quality  of  the  climbing  is  clearly
imported from another solar system, several 5-star routes including arguably the best
19, best 22, 23 and 26 at Boven!. Long routes will sometimes have chains halfway up so
that you can lower off twice to get down. There is plenty of potential for new lines at the
right end of the crag, just be sure it’s not one of the existing trad climbs.

HEIGHT: 20 - 35 Metres ASPECT: Also South facing with the left side of the crag in
morning shade during summer and the right side catching shade in the afternoon. There
are some interesting corners and cracks here with phenomenal photographic potential.

APPROACH (Map on page 117)
The  best  is  to  park  as  for  ACRA  then  access  as  for  the  WB  wall,  then  abseil  (or
scramble) down the WB gulley. At the base of the gulley, walk along the path along the
base of the cliffs until you see the climbs. To exit, either scramble back up the gulley, or
walk approx 200 metres along the base of the crag until you reach the railway and you
will arrive at the top of the WB gully. Walk back through tunnel, if a train comes, press
yourself to one side (apparently safe but absolutely terrifying).

Climbs are described from left to right:

MADIBA MAGIC 18 **** [15D,A] Starts 10 right from the base of the normal descent
gully. In character with the rest of the awesomeness of this crag. FA: Gustav Janse van
Rensburg 2013

bar  in  the  block  under  the  overlap.  Pull  over  this  rightwards  then  easy  to  finish.  FA:
Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2000

MONKEY  PUZZLE    28  ***  [11D]  Climb  straight  up  from  the  third bolt of  FUDGE

the end of your rope! FA: Jens Richter 2005

AS THE WORLD DISAPPEARS  26 ***** [13D] Up the face then leftward through
the overlap to a headwall crack that keeps on coming. 30+m route, steep and sustained
with great photo opportunities. FA: Volker Schweinbenz 1999

CAFFEINE JITTERS 13 ** Was a trad climb, rebolted recently. Scramble up the bushy
slab just right of 'ATWD' and head for the two protruding trees, then climb the awesome
fist sized crack to the top. The climb can be done in a single pitch. FA: Gustav Janse van
Rensburg & Chris Jansen 2001



AMAKROKOKROKO 23 **** [17D,A] Hack up the bushy slope just right of

THE  THREE  MOSQUITOS  21 ****  [18D]  Just  left  of  the big corner.  A  little  crack,
face and roof climbing. You can top out on this route and hike down along the trail back
West  towards  the  mouth  of  the  tunnel.  So  end  your  day  with  this  line  to  avoid  the
scrambles! FA: Thulani Mazibuko 1999





CHAKALAKA  20  ****  [12D]  Break  out  right  after  the  third  bolt  of  THE  THREE
MOSQUITOES. FA: Bine Tittel 2005

15m above. Climb the corner and bypass the roofs on the left, then straight up the head
wall. FA: Mark Seuring & Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2003




124

STATIC  SCAMPERING  18  *** [Trad]  Climb  the  corner  2m  left  of  DFADS;  bypass
overhang  on  left  and  scamper  up  slab  through  overlap  to  top.  FA:  Gustav  Janse  van
Rensburg & Mark Seuring 2003

DUST FROM A DISTANT SUN  19 *** [Trad]  Starts 15m left of FTL. Climb short
overhanging crack. Step 1m right  and pull through roof. Climb slab tending slightly left to
good  abseil  tree.  (Intricate  gear  placements).  FA:  Mark  Seuring  &  Gustav  Janse  van
Rensburg 2003

FOLLOW  THE  LIGHT    25  *** [Trad]  Coming  from  the  East  End,  20m  from  the
tunnel mouth, climb the obvious roof crack by the big tree. From the halfway ledge climb
the off-width to the top. FA: Mark Seuring & Gustav Janse van Rensburg 2003

The East End
A good crag to do some trainspotting...

HEIGHT: 20 Metres ASPECT : This crag faces due east and has lots of shade at the
base.  The  quality  of  the  rock  is  actually  better  than  it  appears  on  face  value.  Lots  of
potential for new routes exist.

APPROACH (Map on page 117):
Park as for ACRA wall then walk back down the road 20 metres then down a little path
on the right onto the railway. Go in easterly direction along the railway then through the
tunnel  (if  a  train  comes  press  flat  against  the  side,  apparently  its  safe  but  absolutely
terrifying!). When you exit the tunnel, the EAST END is found on the left after crossing
another railway line coming out of a 461 m tunnel.

TRAIN MASSACRE [ GPS: S25 38 00.1 E30 20 57.0]
long train tunnel, walk up 10m to find the first bolt. FA: Gary Lotter 1991

BOIPATONG  19 *** [Trad] 6m right of the fence (right of TM). Up to a break, up face,
out left onto a slab, out right (#1 rock behind flake) up to roof, traverse right and up to a
ledge. Ab off tree 15m right. FA: M Loewe & S Hofmeyr 1992


Toon Town

Lots of trad classics and some bolted ones too. The potential here (also behind it on the
other side of the ridge) is largely untapped and one looks down into the valley with the
falls lurking constantly behind you when you climb.

HEIGHT:  12  -  25  Metres.  ASPECT:  One  of  the  few  West  facing  crags,  making  it
perfect for summer mornings. Alternatively come here on cold winter afternoons. Don't
be lazy, slog up the hill now!

25 *** [8D] From the 461m





125


APPROACH (Map on page 117):
Take the N4 highway (east) towards Nelspruit. 1,7km after exiting the tunnel, a dirt road
turns left and crosses the Elands river. Always stay left on this up the hill, back in the
direction of the waterfall until a parking place is reached after a right bend. This road is
known not to always be in good condition. Do not leave any bags or valuables in the
car, locked vehicles have been broken into here.

From the parking, cross the railway track and walk up the hill on faint paths up to the
cliff. On the left is an impressive face with a great fingercrack, MANNENBURG. The
next west face to the left has a seam, THE COLOR PURPLE bounded by 2 wider cracks.

Climbs are described from left to right:

TOPLESS  SKATEBOARD  NUN    23  **  [Trad]  About  50m  left  of  AFRICAN
ODYSSEY,  are  some  big  roofs  halfway  up  the  crag.  Start  up  the  obvious  crack  below
these  and  traverse  left  on  the  ledge  until  you  are  below  the  left  hand  end  of  the  roof.
Climb the crack to the roof. Pull through the cubby hole onto the slab (crux needs friend
#and follow the crack to the top. FA: A Russel-Boulton 1992

UNDER A CHOKING SUN 19 *** [Trad,R] 4m right of TSN. Up orange face moving
right to ledges and up a big shallow corner (crux) to grassy ledge. Finish up crack on right.
Rather gearless! FA: M Loewe, A Lainis 1992

AFRICAN ODYSSEY 25 *** [13D] Starting towards the left, follow the bolts into the
centre  of  the  face,  then  up  a  crack  to  finish.  Take  your  thinnest  fingers.  FA:  Andrew
Lainis 1992

LITTLE  MAN'S  COMPLEX  22  **  [Trad,2B,TA]  Climb  the  corner,  moving  left  onto
the slab and up to the coldshuts. FA: M Loewe 1992

RACHEL AND REBECCA 18 *** [Trad] The short but good-looking corner left of the
arete project. FA: C Curson, B Marcus & L Waldman 1992

POES IN BOOTS  26 * [Trad,3B,TA,R] Climb the middle of the wall 2.5m right of the
an  open  project.  30m  right  of  AFRICAN  ODYSSEY.  The  3rd  clip  is  tricky,  a  gripper,
clipper, whipper - ground fall. Use the chains on the arete. FA: Brett Clarke 1992

NIGHT OF THE CRASH TEST DUMMIES 17 ** [Trad] The biggest crack line on the
left. Traverse slightly right at the top to exit. FA: A Russel-Boulton 1991

THE COLOUR PURPLE
23  ****  [Trad]  On  the  west-facing  wall  to  the  right  are  3
cracks.  The  left  one  goes  at  about  15.  The  seam  in  the  middle  is  this  one.  Vertical  but
tricky - may be 22 for tall dudes.  FA: Jeremy Colenso & Ian Manson 1991

FA: Jeremy Colenso & Ian Manson 1991


20  ***  [Trad]  The  wider  crack  just  to  the  right.

The Wild Side

After  doing  all  the  other  routes  in  Waterval  Boven,  this  crag  with  awesome  views  of
some  other  (better)  crags  will  be  waiting.  Around  the  corner  to  the  East  lies  great
potential for new routing.

HEIGHT:  15  -  20  Metres.  ASPECT:  Facing  South  and  therefore  nice  and  shady  in
winter.

APPROACH (Map on page 117):

16  *  [Trad]  Still  no  sign  of  Dopey.  Somewhere  out  there

ZASM Tunnel entrance - (East)

This  tunnel  is  a  National  Monument.  Leave  your  valuables  at  home  and  do  not  trust
suspicious looking characters. Be brave.

HEIGHT: 18 - 25 Metres. ASPECT: East facing with morning sun.

APPROACH (Map on page 117):
Parking  not  that  safe..maybe  get  dropped  off.  Or  you  can  park  at  tourist  information
stop: when you drive through the road tunnel towards Nelspruit and turn off on the left
immediately after exiting the tunnel. From here, hike towards the old ZASM tunnel, a
national monument. The crag is on your left. There is some potential here, but beware of
locals lurking around. Leave your valuables at home.

The Junkyard

Some  of  the  best  trad  climbs  at  Boven,  most  famously  Boa  Rodeo,  30.  The  crag  is
actually pretty safe but it’s a pity the ledges and the base of the crag are littered with bits
of rubbish. It’s still worth it for the 4 and 5 star lines though.

HEIGHT: 15 - 30 Metres. ASPECT: Most of the climbs face North and are close to the
obvious pinnacle. To escape the sun, just climb on the other side or go across to the other
side of the gorge.

APPROACH (Map on page 117):
Drive into the township, pass the post boxes and Shebeens (bars) then take the next right.
Follow  this  road,  around  a  bend  past  the  high  school  on  the  left.  After  another  100
metres, take a sharp right beside house ‘675’. Follow this rough track, through the grass,
past  some  pig  sties  to  a  rocky  parking  area  by  some  large  prehistoric-looking  plants.
Walk  to  the  large  rocks  at  the  cliff  edge  and  on  the  right  you  will  find  a  couple  of
gulleys. One has fig tree a few metres down, this is ok for abesils, or, go further right and
there is a relatively easy (possibly nappy filled) dark dusty gulley/chimney to scramble
down.

The  following  climbs  are  on  or  beside  the  obvious  free  standing  Coming  Of  Pride
pinnacle which can be viewed from the top of the cliff, just to the right of the descent
gully.

ZASM Tunnel entrance - (West)

Why on why…? Only the British! Some young English lads found THIS spot to climb -
and write it up!

HEIGHT: 8 Metres. ASPECT: This is not really a crag, but in fact an artificially made
area. The engineers of the late 1800’s blasted out this passage and dumped all the rocks
out on the scree slope below.

APPROACH (Map on page 117):
From the viewing deck on the West side of the tunnel, walk out towards the road. The
route is on your left

FANTASY FONDUE FORFIT [ GPS: S25 38 10.5 E30 20 42.3] 15 [Trad] At the west

Waterval Onder – Luilekker Crags

Waterval Onder is dutch for beneath the waterfall, and that’s where it is. You can’t miss
the  big  rambling  dark  red  brown  cliffs  on  the  right  side  of  the  road  a  few  kilometres
down the hill past Boven.

Be sure to call the owners of Luilekker Guest House (013 257 7056 or 082 800 1144)
before you climb here. These crags have great potential and the land owner is keen to get
more
stay
(http://www.luilekker.co.za).

HEIGHT:  18  -  50  Metres.  ASPECT:    The  bowl-like  feature  faces  north  and  bakes
throughout the year. This crag could be slightly warmer than those in Waterval Boven
due to the drop in altitude as one drives down. Best go on a cloudy cold day or in the
evening.

APROACH
Take  the  N4  highway  in  the  direction  of  Nelspruit.  Look  for  the  well  sign  posted
Luilekker Guest House, 2.5km after the tunnel on the right. [ GPS: S25 38 51.9 E30 21

middle of the main face.  Pitch 1. 17 ** 35m. Start on the face 10m left of the obvious,
shallow  lunch  cave.  Climb  up  tending  right  into  a  recess  till  a  large  ledge  below  an
overhanging  face.    Pitch  2.  23  ***  20m.  Start  at  back  left  corner  of  ledge.  Climbs
strenuous corner crack for 6m the traverse right for 3m on good holds and exposure. Fire
straight up to a ledge from where one can belay and walk off.  A: Alard Hüfner & Gustav
Janse van Rensburg 2001

Waterval Onder – The Aloes

This crag can be seen from the increasingly popular Aloes Restaurant and Backpackers
Lodge.

HEIGHT: 45 Metres

ASPECT: This North facing crag could be quite warm. The route ALLO, ALOE will
enjoy morning shade in its right facing corner. There is still loads of potential for sport
or trad lines.

APROACH
Drive out of town, turn right on the N4 to Nelspruit and through the tunnel. 3.5km after
the tunnel on your left is a parking area [ GPS: S25 38 44.2 E30 22 26.5] in front of the
Aloes Backpackers and Restaurant. Kevin and Tracy manage this spot and will look after
your car if you buy some fresh or smoked trout and a drink from them afterwards. Cross
the N4 and walk straight up the hill.

ALLO ALOE  15 ***  [Trad] This route climbs the obvious right facing break that forms
a  corner  in  the  middle  of  the  face.  The  opening  party  climbed  it  in  two  pitches  of  25
metres  each.  From  the  top,  walk  15m  right  to  a  good  abseil  tree.  Abseil  to  ledge  and
another good tree will bring you  back to the ground. FA: Gustav Janse van Rensburg &
Chris Jansen 2001.
