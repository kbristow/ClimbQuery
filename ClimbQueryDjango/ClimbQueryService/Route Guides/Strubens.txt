RED FRED	15 [5D] Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


BLUE GLUE	11 [5D] Shares top anchors with RED FRED. Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


INTO PINK	18 ** [6D] On the left hand side of the Upper band, slightly above the rest of the cliffs is a steep red broken buttress with a large thin flake 3m high in the centre, at its base. Climb the crack on the left hand side of the flake to its top, then step up left to above a small overhang. From there continue up slightly right via a small recess to the top.	Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


THINK PINK	18 ** [6B] Climb the crack on the right of the flake (see INTO PINK) continuing up to the corner above, then at its top climb another small corner, just to the right of the ridge, to the top. Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


SLIVER ARROWS	16 [7D] Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


GREEN LIGHT	13 [6D] Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


PINK HOT PEPPERS	14 * [6D] Straddle up short dark brown square recess to the right of THINK PINK, and just to the left of a cave with blocks in it. Step left at the large block which is at the top of the recess. Has a tricky start.	Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


PURPLE FRENZY	20 ** [6D] Walk down 10m from THINK PINK to a lower buttress with a smooth undercut bulge at its base. Balance up bulge along a ridge 1m to the right of white streak, to a flared crack underneath an overhang. Pull over overhang and continue up easier ground to the top, keeping to the ridge. Bolted by: Neil Margetts.


GOAT CRACK	17 ** [6D] To the right of PURPLE FRENZY is an obvious crack leading to an open hook above with blocks in it. Climb initial section (crux) to cubby hole, then continue up steep crack above on good grips to the top.

BALDERDASH	15 [6D] Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


BUMBLE BEE	9 * [G] 4m to the right of GOAT CRACK is a small tree. Climb left of tree to ledge, then move up left via crack to a ledge 1m to the right of the cubby hole of GOAT CRACK. Then climb up cracks above to the top.


SADDLEBAGS	16 [7D] Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


LIFE IN THE FAST LANE	19 ** [7D] About 7m to the right of BUMBLE BEE is a 4.5m high thin crack with peg scars in it (dark rock). Climb the crack to a small ledge and instead of moving up left to easy ground, reach right to another crack/corner, which is followed to the top. If the block on the right is used to straddle, the grade is reduced. Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


LAUGHTER OF THE MORTALS	10 [G] 2m to the right of LIFE IN THE FAST LANE is a slab leading to a chimney in between to obvious ridges. Start to the right, and step left into the chimney which is then climbed to the top.


TEA BAGGING	12 *** [7D] Two ridges are mentioned in LAUGHTER OF THE MORTALS. Climb up the right side of the right ridge on big jugs to the top. Bolted by: Neil Margetts.


GETTING AIR	16 ** [6D] Move up the centre of wall which is to the right of TEA BAGGING to the top (avoiding good grips on TEA BAGGING and the crack on the right) Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


GET TUBED	14 ** [5D] To the right of TEA BAGGING is an obvious, attractive scoop shaped overhanging face with two corners on either side. Climb the left hand corner to the top, moving left near the top. Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


TIDAL WAVE	29 ** [7D] Climb the scooped face up the middle.	Bolted by:	Neil Margetts.


CUTBACK SPRAY	18 * [G] Climb the right hand side of the scoop mentioned in IS THERE ANYBODY IN THERE, to the top.


BARRACUDA	17 ** [G] 3m to the right of the start of IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE is a bushy tree. Above the tree is a small corner with a few roots in it at the base. Climb this corner to an overhang, rail left, and move up corner on left until one can step right again, to above the previously mentioned overhang. Then continue past fig tree to top.


MUSSEL CRACKER	20 * [PG] 2,5m to the right of the tree mentioned in BARACUDA is another similar tree. Step onto grey face here and climb up to the large ledge above. Above this is a short overhanging face with a break in it directly above the start. Climb this break which leads into a crack higher up, to the top.


THUNDER THIGHS	11 [PG] Start as for MUSSEL CRACKER, but tend rightwards towards a tree. Then climb up through the tree onto another ledge. Continue along ledge until possible to easily climb to the top.


THUNDER THIGHS DIRECT	13 ** [G] 4m to the right of THUNDER THIGHS are a few large boulders. On the right of these is a tree next to the crag. Step into the corner below the prominent overhang 3m up. Climb up to the ledge above. Then continue up corner to the tree of THUNDER THIGHS. Continue directly to the top.


LUNAR LIGHT TRAVERSE	20 *** [G] 1.	25m	20	This is a superb girdle traverse, probably the best route on the crag. At the thin tree mentioned in THUNDER THIGHS DIRECT, climb up for 3m until you can traverse right along the obvious rail under the fig tree. Continue for 25m at the lip of the cave until you get to another fig tree. Climb up 4m to a ledge.	2.	10m	15	Walk right, to below the nose. Move up on the right hand side and swing around left to the obvious hand crack. Follow this to its end and then continue to top.	Note: This route has to be led. The first pitch is sustained, and is as hard to follow as it is to lead.


STUMBLING PILGRIM	22 ** [PG] Start about 3m to the right of the start of LUNAR LIGHT TRAVERSE below the fig tree. Climb up to the rail and up on small grips to a small recess to the left of a nose and to the right of a fig tree. Climb up this for 3m to easier ground which is followed to the top.


BLACK MAGIC	23 ** [G] Above the right hand side of the boulders mentioned in THUNDER THIGHS DIRECT is an obvious vee shaped break in the roof above. Pull up initial overhang using underclings to the rail, continue up to break, then climb through break (crux) to easier ground, continue up vague recess above to the top.


MAGIC MUSHROOM	25 *** [?B] Move up diagonally left, starting half a metre to the left of the start of TIDAL WAVE, to the rail. Move up to a bolt. Continue up through the overhanging rock above, past the second bolt to the top. Do not use the grips that would normally be used for the routes on either side for handholds or footholds.


VOODOO	21 *** [G] About 3m to the right of BLACK MAGIC is a large obvious corner. Climb directly up to the corner after negotiating the initial overhang, climb the corner (crux) and continue straight up crack above without stepping right onto easier rock (a superb direct line).


STICKY WICKET	20 ** [G] Start as for TIDAL WAVE to the rail. Rail right to a corner, move right onto the nose and then up to grips above a thin crack. Then move up diagonally left to a ledge. Continue up to the top.


STICKY WICKET DIRECT	24 ** [PG] Pull up into the corner to the right of the start of TIDAL WAVE (reachy). Then execute a very contrived pull through the roof above, without touching the right wall of the corner. (Height is a definite advantage for both cruxes).


THE END OF THE NIGHT	19 A2 ** [G] 3m to the right of STICKY WICKET DIRECT is a hairline crack running through the initial bulge, widening to finger size higher up. Aid (A3) up initial section on blades and poor nuts to the rail, then continue up crack above (free climbing) with some difficult moves (19) near the top.


MENTAL BLOCK	24 *** [G] 5m to the right of the start of STICKY WICKET DIRECT is an obvious jug handhold about 3m up, at the lip of the cave. Move onto this dynamically and continue up to a rest on the rail (crux) . Continue up over second overhang (20) and up to top.


HOT CANARY	19 * [G] 5m to the right of the start of MENTAL BLOCK is a short root filled crack. Climb this to the rail, ascend wide crack above (crux) to a ledge. Then avoid grotty rock above by traversing right for 5m to an attractive nose with an obvious hand crack on its left hand side. Climb this to the top, starting on its right hand side. (As in LUNAR LIGHT TRAVERSE)


STARGAZER	23 *** [G] 5m to the right of HOT CANARY is a short corner topped by a roof. To its right, above 2 large, flatish boulders are 2 smooth, overhanging bulges. Straddle up the corner to the roof, then rail right above the first bulge to a cramped position. Pull through second bulge strenuously until the grade eases, then continue up ridge above (excellent dynamic moves)


SMOKE ALLEY	21 ** [G] At the right hand end of the big cave. 4m to the right, and around the corner from the start of STARGAZER is a crack up an overhanging recess. Climb this (crux) and follow easy cracks to the top.


JUGULAR VEIN	22 ** [G] About 1,5m to the right of SMOKE ALLEY is an obvious crack running up and through overhangs. JUGUALR VEIN climbs this crack.


EYES OF FIRE	18 ** [G] Climb the crack to the right of JUGUALR VEIN to the top. Continue up easy ground above.


CURMUDGEN CORNER	13 * [G] Start 10m up BLACK JACK GULLY in a short obvious corner with yellow and grey patches. This is just to the left of a dusty cave whose ceiling consists of large boulders. Climb the corner and continue past the tree above to the top.


BLACK JACK GULLY	5 The obvious decent route with tree at base.


DEVIOUS	19 ** [?] Climb face 1m right of EYES OF FIRE through overhang to top.


ENVIOUS	18 ** [?] Climb shallow recess 1m to the right and around the corner of DEVIOUS.



NEIL YOUNG BUTTRESS OUT OF THE BLACK	20 ** [PG] About 4m up BLACK JACK GULLY on the true left is an obvious finger crack up a grey and cream streaked wall. Climb the crack to a rail, then pull straight through the centre of the steep face above to reach the top.


INTO THE BLUE	15 ** [G] Climb the crack system directly above the tree at the base of BLACK JACK GULLY. Climb up past some white streaks to an undercling rail. Then move left onto further cracks and ascend (passing a tree on the right) to the top.


THRASHER	20 * [PG] To the right of INO THE BLUE is a large overhang about 2m up. Start as for HEART OF GOLD and step up left onto the lip of the overhang. Then follow the thin crack past the small tree to the undercling rail and second overhang. Pull through centre of second overhang at about 1.5m to the right of INTO THE BLUE. Continue straight to the top.


HEART OF GOLD	20 ** [PG] On the front of the Neil Young Buttress at the base of the crag are 3 large boulders under an overhang, the right hand one forming a 2m high pillar. Start up the pillar, then climb crack above. Continue straight up recess above (crux) and finish on ridge at top.


LOST COMPANIONS	14 ** [G] 1m to the right of the pillar mentioned in HEART OF GOLD is a thin crack up a dark wall. Climb this past some small bushes into a wider crack, which is followed to the top.


POKOHARNESS	14 ** [PG] 1m to the right of LOST COMPANIONS is a thin crack with roots at the top. Climb this.


CRYSTAL CANYONS	10 * [G] Climb the deep crack 1m right of POKOHARNESS.


AURORA BOREALIS	21 [PG] To the right of CRYSTAL CANYONS is an overhanging bulge with a tree at its base (in the centre). Up the wall/bulge are 2 thin cracks on either side of the tree. Climb the left hand crack.


JOHNNY ROTTEN	19 [PG] Climb the right hand crack of the 2 cracks mentioned in AURORA BOREALIS.


HAY HAY MY MY	16 *** [PG] Around the corner to the right of JOHNNY ROTTEN is an attractive face. Start on the left, moving through initial overhang onto the face. Avoiding ledges on the left, step right onto a small ledge about 2m above the ground. Climb directly up the centre of the brown yellow face above to the top. Note:	An easier variation can be climbed up the left arete.

YOUNG MAN’S ENTRANCE	14 ** [PG] One day whilst wandering aimlessly around the top of the crag too lazy to walk down. I decided to scramble down and inadvertently opened a route worth writing up. 10m to the right of HAY HAY MY MY is a broken face shaded closely by a large tree. Start by a clump of routes about the size of a woman’s foot embedded in the face. Climb straight up towards a sturdy Combretum tree.

WOW	14 ** [G] Around the corner to the right of YOUNG MAN’s ENTRANCE are two obvious brown corners. Climb the left hand corner to an overhang, then instead of going left to easier ground, make in interesting, cramped rail right to a position above GRAVITY DON’T DUST. Continue from here to top.


GRAVITY DON’T DUST	18 ** [R] Climb delicately up the orange arete to the right of WOW to a pointed overhang. Pull through and continue to top.


ZEALOT ZONE	13 ** [G] Climb the right hand corner mentioned in WOW, until you can step right onto a ledge. Climb further up face above. Continue up a series of cracks and ledges to top.


PURPLE MOON	8 * [G] Start 2m to the left of PURPLE SKY, and continue straight up the crack (with a tree in it) to the top, moving right at the tree.


PURPLE SKY	12 *** [PG] Climb up attractive face 10m up and right of GRAVITY DON’T DUST, keeping strictly to the face all the way up (jug land).


LAND OF SMILES	14 ** [G] Climb the ridge 3m to the right of PURPLE SKY, starting on the left of the arete on an easy angle slab and finishing on the right hand side of the ridge.


SONG OF SONGS	10 * [G] To the right of LAND OF SMILES is a deep crack running up a series of ledges. Climb the crack and step left at its top. Exit right.


BYE BYE BLUES	11 ** [PG] Climb the ridge to the right of SONG OF SONGS on good but far apart jugs to the top.


SONG OF JOY	12 ** [G] Climb the orange recess with cracks in it on the right of BYE BYE BLUES. This recess has an overhang in it about three quarters of the way up.


ORE	13 ** [G] On the right hand side of the crag (i.e. 10m to the right and 15m up from SONG OF JOY) is a zig-zag wide crack running through a series of juggy bulges which is slightly undercut at its base. Climb up the crack to the top.



ROADSIDE ATTRACTIONS CRAG


DYLAN’S ELIMINATE	18 A girdle traverse of the left-hand portion of the lower level of Strubens. Start on the left at the second bolt on the very first route, and continue at approximately the same height to the very last route on the right. It goes at about 18 in both directions (climbed both ways). First ascent:	Dylan Morgan.


MEADOW LANE	9 * [5B,A] Follow the left-most line of bolts up the grooves and ledges to where you can reach the lower-offs. A slightly easier variation is found if you deviate 1-2m left after the first bolt.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


EASTERN BYPASS	16 ** [5B,A] Start up MEADOW LANE to the base of a thin corner groove, straight up the wall to the right. Climb the corner to gain the lower-offs on the left.

First ascent: 1995	Clive Curson.


ROADSIDE RHAPSODY	17 ** [5B,A] Go up the stepped groove in the slab 5m left of the nose, until the wall steepens at the third bolt. Less strenuous than the routes on the right.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


PANIC ALLEY	21 ** [5B,A] Start up the short smooth face to the faint crack line 1.5m left of the nose. Can be climbed straight through the bolt line at the crux. If you choose to layback, there may be a temptation to use easier holds far out right. Climb the headwall slab to lower-offs..

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


ROAD WARRIOR	19 *** [5B,A] The nose route. Experience a steep start past the ex-tree. Don’t hang around too long or gravity will catch up. Go straight up the crack to lower-offs on the right. ‘Legal’ holds can be used just to the right, but if you ignore all of these, the grade is about 21.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE	17 *** [4B,A] Probably led by various of the Margetts clan in the 80’s. Start 2m right of the root on the nose, following the double crack system to the base of the smaller groove at the top. Climb up this to lower-offs.

Bolted by: 1994 Clive Curson.


HIGHWAY MAN	17 ** [4B,A] Start about 3m right of the nose. Climb steeply up a spidery crack system to easier ground finishing in the larger groove/recess.

Bolted by: 1994 Clive Curson.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.



THE POLITICIAN'S CRAG


VISIONS OF URBAN GLOOM	5 ** [2B,A] The easiest sport route in the country/Africa/Southern hemisphere? Almost anyone should be able to lead it even with no previous climbing experience. Climb the face 8m right of the short gully. Bolted by: Clive Curson. First ascent: Soloed in the 80’s.


JOBURG BOWSAW MASSACRE	6 ** [2B,A] If the root looks like becoming a bush again, apply a chainsaw. Climb the face 10m right of the gully past 2 bolts. Same lower-offs as for VOUG. Bolted by:	Clive Curson. First ascent:	?


INFORMAL SETTLEMENT	7 ** [3B,A] Start at the large recess/break. After the second bolt climb out right to gin the smooth slab which is followed to lower-offs.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


REDISTRIBUTION	8 ** [3B,A] Starting at the base of the recess, follow the line of weakness diagonally across under INFORMAL SETTLEMENT’s slab to the crack system to its right. Climb this and use IS’s lower-offs.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


DIRECT REDISTRIBUTION	14 ** [3B,A] Start 1m right of the large recess and climb REDISTRIBUTION’s crack all the way from the ground using the same bolts.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


DISTRICT SIX	18 ** [4B,A] Climb up to the large peapod groove to the bulge. The crux is using a layback move to the right, in the middle of the bolt line. The temptation to stray is great: nice move if you don’t.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


THE POLITICAL ANGLE	17 ** [3B,A] Teeter up the smooth slab just left of the arete. It gets more positive – eventually. Finish leftwards to the lower-offs on DISTRICT SIX.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


GANG WARFARE	18 ** [3B,A] Climb the crack on the right of the bulge and 1.5m right of the nose. Move up, then right and up on layback holds.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


CITY SLICKER	19 ** [3B,A] The route up the smooth, whitish nose. Follow the thin crackline up the nose, without straying too far either way. A tad contrived. Go a little left after the third bolt to the GANG WARFARE lower-offs..

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


HOME BOY	14 ** [4B,A] Climbs the face to the right of the nose. There are some great incuts on this one. Go slightly right to lower-offs overlooking the large recess.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


HEAVY TRAFFIC	13 ** [4B,A] Start up the featured arete to the right of a large recess about 4m right of the CITY SLICKER nose. Climb the juggy rock, going left at the top to the lower-offs. Crux is just after the first bolt.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


URBAN LEGEND	13 *** [4B,A] Climbs a striking red corner all the way to the top.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


DARK STREETS	12 ** [4B,A] Between the corner and a dark recess is a vague break through a face with glue-on blocks – right above the tree / roots. Most remaining holds feel solid, but exercise some care. Go left at the top on bug jugs (rather steep).

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


JUDGEMENT DAY	20 ** [4B,A] Climb the smooth, light-coloured face to the right of the dark crack / recess. Don’t reach past the edge of the face.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


SKYWALKER	14 ** [4B,A] Start up the excellent left-facing corner just right of the whitish face. The corner flattens out higher up.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


BAD KARMA	19 ** [4B,A] About 5m right of SKYWALKER is a recess with a deep crack on the left and a ledge on the right. Climb the corner on the right of the recess (using a jam near the top) to lower offs on the arete to the right. Can get a bit muddy and take care of the loose rocks at the top.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


DRUGS AND DEATH	20+ ** [4B,A] Start 2-3m right of the BAD KARMA recess. Climb the smooth orangey-red wall on good incuts. Tend left towards the arete. Not as easy as it looks, and much harder for midgets.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


STREET PREACHER (Eliminate)	25 ** [4B] Climb the smooth overhanging face to the right of DRUGS AND DEATH on thin holds. A bolt exists at the top which can be used to top-rope the route. Note:	If you use the grips on the left, the grade drops to 23. First ascent:	2005	Neil Margetts.


KEEN DUDE	19 *** [4B,A] Start 4m right of the BAD KARMA recess. Climb past a tree root on a ledge 1.5m up. Climb the crack above to a notch in the roof. Give the scree above a definite miss. Also a little reach dependant.

THE RED ZONE 25 ** [4B,A] Climbs a crackline about 7m right of the BAD KARMA recess into a groove between 2 small buttresses. Start just right of the first bolt. Much harder if the holds left of the arete are not used or if you are vertically challenged. This route and those to the right had seen previous top rope action. Bolted by: 1995	Clive Curson First ascent:	?


THE CONFIDENCE REEFER 27 ** [4B,A] Climbs the bulging buttress just left of STREETFIGHTER, using the first 3 bolts of STREETFIGHTER and one hanger bolt out to the left. Don’t use the crack to the right. Bolted by:	1995 Clive Curson + 1 new bolt. First ascent: ?


STREETFIGHTER	21 ** [4B,A] Climb up the well defined crack with hand-jam to cubby hole. Pull out left onto the smooth buttress at the roof. Watch the rope on sharp edges when lowering-off. Reachy.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


MANIC MONDAY	22 [4B,A] Start 1.5m right of the STREETFIGHTER crack. Stretch/balance up to a god jug. Pull past the right of the roof to 0.5m to the right, using good technique for maximum brownie points.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


HEAVY DUTY	23 [4B,A] Start 3m right of STREETFIGHTER. Climb up and left to a well-wedged small flake. Pull the steep finish to clip off a good rail just left of the lower-offs. Without hooking the block to the left the grade goes up somewhat. Short persons may also find this harder.

First ascent:	1994	Clive Curson.


CORNER ROUTE	18 ** [3B,A] Climb up crack in the corner. Crux is just before the first bolt, which is way up there.

First ascent: Unknown
